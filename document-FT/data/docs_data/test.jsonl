{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the template filter in Blended?", "completion": "The template filter in Blended is used to compile a string into a template object, allowing for the introduction of templates within the language."}
{"prompt": "Can the escape filter be used on variables or only on strings?", "completion": "The escape filter can be applied to both strings and variables. It is typically used on strings to ensure that any special characters are properly encoded."}
{"prompt": "Is it allowed for macros to call each other in a circular manner?", "completion": "No, circular calls between and among macros are prohibited."}
{"prompt": "Can a variable be defined inside a loop and then used outside of the loop?", "completion": "The variable is not available outside the loop. It is local to the loop and cannot be accessed outside of it."}
{"prompt": "Can the `items` filter be used in combination with other filters or modifiers?", "completion": "Yes, the `items` filter can be used in combination with other filters or modifiers to further process the list of key-value pairs."}
{"prompt": "Can macros call each other directly without any restrictions?", "completion": "Yes, macros can call each other directly without any restrictions."}
{"prompt": "Can a macro access variables defined outside its macro tags?", "completion": "No, a macro in Blended cannot access variables defined outside its macro tags. It operates within its own isolated scope."}
{"prompt": "Can a user-defined function have the same name as a template-defined macro, variable, or imported module in Blended?", "completion": "No, a user-defined function cannot have the same name as a template-defined macro, variable, or imported module in Blended."}
{"prompt": "Can I declare the same blended object twice in a Blended program?", "completion": "In Blended, multiple declarations of a blended object are not allowed. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error."}
{"prompt": "What happens if the for loop is executed but the else section is not executed?", "completion": "In Blended, if the for loop is executed but the else section is not executed, it means that the for loop iterated over all items in the list and the else section was not triggered."}
{"prompt": "What if a variable is set inside an if section and else section of if else statement and used outside if else statement?", "completion": "Yes, it is valid since variable presence is guaranteed before usage. "}
{"prompt": "Can a variable be declared inside scope A and used in scope B?", "completion": "No, variable declared inside scope A can be used in scope A only and not in any other scope"}
{"prompt": "Can a for...else statement access variables defined in the root template?", "completion": "Yes, a for...else statement can access variables defined in the root template."}
{"prompt": "What if a variable is defined in a parent scope and then a child scope tries to modify it?", "completion": "The child scope will not be able to modify the variable. It will be read-only and cannot be changed."}
{"prompt": "What is the significance of the prescribed behavior of a statement in Blended?", "completion": "The prescribed behavior of a statement in Blended determines how a code segment is rendered. This behavior is defined by the statement to which the code segment belongs."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the Else scope in Blended templates?", "completion": "The Else scope is used to define the code that should be executed if the condition in a conditional statement is not met."}
{"prompt": "What if the for loop is not executed due to a condition outside the loop?", "completion": "In Blended, if the for loop is not executed due to a condition outside the loop, the else section will not execute any code."}
{"prompt": "Can a macro access variables that are not defined in the caller's scope?", "completion": "No, a macro can only access variables that are explicitly passed as arguments."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a variable is defined in the 'Loop' scope and then used outside of it?", "completion": "If a variable is defined within the 'Loop' scope and then used outside of it, it will not be accessible outside of the loop. Linter will throw an error."}
{"prompt": "What if a macro in Blended shares the name of a function defined in the same scope?", "completion": "The macro will not be defined, and we will get an error from the compiler"}
{"prompt": "Can a variable be redefined in a child scope?", "completion": "No, it cannot be redefined. In Blended, multiple declarations of a variable are not allowed. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error."}
{"prompt": "What happens if there are no items in the list being iterated over in a for...else block?", "completion": "In Blended, if there are no items in the list being iterated over in a for...else block, the code inside the else section will be executed."}
{"prompt": "Can a variable defined in a parent scope be accessed in a child scope?", "completion": "Yes, a variable defined in a parent scope is available for use within child or descendant scopes."}
{"prompt": "What is the scope of variables, macros, and modules in a Blended template?", "completion": "The scope of variables, macros, and modules in a Blended template is the root template, excluding all macro tags, block tags, and for...else statements."}
{"prompt": "Can I use the safe filter on a regular string to make it safe?", "completion": "Yes, you can use the safe filter on a regular string to make it safe. This is useful when you want to ensure that a string containing potentially harmful content is treated as safe for output."}
{"prompt": "How does the 'Iterator' scope differ from other scopes in Blended?", "completion": "The 'Iterator' scope is distinct from other scopes in Blended because it is specifically designed to handle iteration objects within the 'for...else' block. This ensures that the iterator is properly managed and does not affect other parts of the code."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a template is rendered multiple times with different data?", "completion": "Each time the template is rendered, it will use the data provided at the time of the render invocation."}
{"prompt": "What is a properly formatted string for the datetime filter?", "completion": "A properly formatted string for the datetime filter should be in a format that can be parsed into a timestamp, such as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or '2023-10-05 14:30:00'."}
