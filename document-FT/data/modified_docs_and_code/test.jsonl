{"prompt": "In the event that a macro tries to access a variable that is not defined within its scope or not passed as an argument, what would be the result?", "completion": "The macro will raise an error indicating that the variable is not defined."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to utilize built-in functions within a macro?", "completion": "Yes, you can access built-in functions inside macro. "}
{"prompt": "If I were to employ a loop variable to hold a value that serves as a temporary storage for intermediate outcomes?", "completion": "Yes, you can use a loop variable to store a value that is used to store intermediate results. For example, in a loop that calculates the factorial of a number, you can use a variable like `factorial` to store the intermediate results."}
{"prompt": "What is the function of the template filter in the Blended system?", "completion": "The template filter in Blended is used to compile a string into a template object, allowing for the introduction of templates within the language."}
{"prompt": "Does the variable 'var' exist in the macro's context?", "completion": "No, macro scope only contains the template code inside macro tags. "}

{"prompt": "Does Blended's macros support recursive calls to themselves?", "completion": "Yes, macros in Blended can make recursive calls to themselves."}
{"prompt": "Could you explain the order in which block scope instances are evaluated in the Blended system?", "completion": "The order of evaluation of block scope instances in Blended is determined by the order in which they are defined in the template. In root templates, the order is determined by the order of the block scope instances in the template. In child templates, the order is determined by the order of the block scope instances in the template that extends it."}
{"prompt": "Determine the five essential functions included in Blended", "completion": "Here are the five built in functions in Blended : lower, upper, length, mean, rgbcolor etc."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to invert the sign of a negative number in Blended?", "completion": "Yes, you can negate a negative number in Blended. For example, {{ -(-10) }} will result in 10."}
{"prompt": "Does a macro in a programming language have the capability to access variables that are defined in the caller's scope but are not included as parameters?", "completion": "No, a macro can only access variables that are explicitly passed as arguments."}
{"prompt": "What are the four unique delimiters utilized to separate tags from static text in the Blended system?", "completion": "There are 3 pairs of delimiters present in blended and not 4. The three pairs of delimiters used to distinguish tags from static text in Blended are {% and %}, {{ and }}, and {# and #}."}
{"prompt": "How many distinct scopes are involved in the for...else statement?", "completion": "There are 3 distinct scopes associated with for...else statement - Iterator, loop, else. "}
{"prompt": "Go through the numbers 1 to 5 and display 'Count: + number' for each odd number.", "completion": "{% for i in range(1 , 6) %}{% if i % 2 == 1 %}{{'Count: ' ~  i|string }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}"}
{"prompt": "What would occur if I use the escape filter on a string that has already been escaped?", "completion": "If a string is already escaped, applying the escape filter again will not change its content. The string will remain in its escaped form."}
{"prompt": "Can I declare the same blended object twice in a Blended program?", "completion": "In Blended, multiple declarations of a blended object are not allowed. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error."}
{"prompt": "Could the `title` function differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters?", "completion": "No, the `title` function is case-insensitive. It will capitalize the first letter of each word regardless of the case of the original string."}
{"prompt": "Design a block called 'breadcrumb' and output the variable 'breadcrumb_path'.", "completion": "{% block breadcrumb %}{{ breadcrumb_path }}{% endblock %}"}
{"prompt": "In the context of Blended, what occurs when a variable is employed before it has been declared?", "completion": "In Blended, using a variable before it is defined will result in a syntax error."}
{"prompt": "Can I use 'forloop' as a variable name in the Blended environment?", "completion": "Yes, 'forloop' is a reserved keyword and can be used as a variable name, but it is only accessible within the scope of the 'loop' block."}
{"prompt": "Round the number 3.14159 to two decimal places and print the result.", "completion": "{% print truncate(3.14159, 2) %}"}
{"prompt": "Develop a macro called tax_calculator that accepts an amount parameter. Initialize tax_rate to 0. If the amount exceeds 5000, set tax_rate to 0.15; otherwise, set it to 0.10. The macro should return the product of amount and tax_rate.", "completion": "{% macro tax_calculator(amount) %}{% set tax_rate = 0 %}{% if amount > 5000 %}{% set tax_rate = 0.15 %}{% else %}{% set tax_rate = 0.10 %}{% endif %}{{ amount * tax_rate }}{% endmacro %}"}
{"prompt": "What happens when a variable is utilized in Blended before it is initialized?", "completion": "In Blended, using a variable before it is defined will result in a syntax error."}
{"prompt": "What would happen if I tried to negate a string in the Blended platform?", "completion": "In Blended, negating a string is not allowed. Attempting to use the `-` operator on a string will result in a syntax error."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to use loops or conditions to modify items in the context?", "completion": "No, you cannot use loops or conditions to modify items in the context. These constructs are used to iterate over or conditionally process items, but they do not allow modification."}
{"prompt": "When a variable is defined in a parent scope and a child scope tries to redefine it, what is the outcome?", "completion": "The child scope will not be able to redefine the variable as multiple declarations are not allowed in Blended."}
{"prompt": "Can I use the title function to filter in Blended?", "completion": "No, title is a function in blended and hence cannot be used as filter in blended. "}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the lower part in the Blended system?", "completion": "The lower function in Blended is a built-in function that converts a string to lowercase."}
{"prompt": "If the item to be verified is not present within the string or array, what will occur?", "completion": "The 'in' operator returns `false` if the item is not found in the string or array."}
{"prompt": "Convert the variable 'title' to uppercase and print it", "completion": "Error : Title is a reserved keyword in Blended. It cannot be used as variable nam"}
{"prompt": "What are the most efficient ways to use `loop.first` and `loop.last` in a conditional statement within a for loop?", "completion": "You can use `loop.first` and `loop.last` in a conditional statement to perform different actions based on whether the current iteration is the first or last one. For example, you might want to print a special message for the first iteration or the last iteration."}
{"prompt": "Define 'priority' as 'HIGH' and then uppercase it", "completion": "{% set priority = 'high' %}\r\n{{ upper(priority) }}"}
