{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: or' operator is not valid with potentially undefined object properties\nWhat could happen if I employ the 'or' operator with a potentially undefined property in Blended?", "completion": "In Blended, using the 'or' operator with a potentially undefined object property will result in a runtime error. This is because the 'or' operator in Blended is not designed to handle undefined values in the same way as it does in Jinja/Twig. Instead, it will evaluate the left operand and if it is truthy, it will return the left operand; otherwise, it will return the right operand. If the left operand is undefined, it will return the right operand, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Items not present in context cannot be used directly\nCould I incorporate a variable from my sibling's scope into the Blended environment?", "completion": "In Blended, to use a variable from a sibling context, you must explicitly pass it down as an argument to the current context.

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Macros are different: the only external objects automatically accessible from inside a macro are built-in functions, user functions, and whatever other macros were defined inside the same scope.\nDoes macro functionality in software allow access to variables defined outside the scope in which they are declared?", "completion": "No, macros can only access variables defined inside their scope or those explicitly passed as arguments."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: No data names used in any parent or ancestor scope may be modified or overridden within any child or descendant scope--they are read-only within the child or descendant scope. This means that names in use by the parent scope (or in any ancestor scope) may not be used as a target for set, as a macro name, as a name for a module imported using the import tag, or as an iteration item in the for tag. Only names declared within the current scope may be overwritten.\nCould I establish a goal for the variable defined in the outer environment?", "completion": "No, you cannot set a target for a variable declared in parent scope as they are read only and cannot be modified."}

For example, `title('hello world')` will return 'Hello World'."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Negate (-) operator works on integers. {{ -10 }} is allowed.\nWhat are the key differences between negating a positive and a negative number in Blended?", "completion": "In Blended, negating a positive number results in a negative number, and negating a negative number results in a positive number. For example, {{ -5 }} will result in -5, and {{ -(-5) }} will result in 5."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: When Blended code is parsed and compiled, the resultant template instance retains the ordered relationship of the static text to any statements contained within that text. If any named statement tag is immediately followed by a newline character, that character is removed from the template (with the exception of endverbatim tags).\nIf a named statement tag is immediately followed by a newline character in a Blended template, what happens?", "completion": "The newline character is removed from the template, except for endverbatim tags."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The import tag adds a module to the current scope. The macros declared inside the imported file, and only those macros, are added as members of the module, accessible through dot notation. Because the imported template is independently evaluated by Blended-Lint prior to importation, it is ensured that all macros accessible via the module will be without conflict amongst themselves. All other contents of the imported template (including any variables set or macros or modules imported) are ignored and discarded upon import. Variable data (i.e. non-macro data) is not imported.\nWhen a macro from an imported file has the same name as a macro in the current scope, what happens?", "completion": "In Blended, if a macro in the imported file has the same name as a macro in the current scope, the macro in the imported file will overwrite the macro in the current scope."}

This ensures that the iterator is properly managed and does not interfere with other parts of the code."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: or' operator is not valid with potentially undefined object properties\nIn what situations might the use of the 'or' operator with potentially undefined object properties result in errors?", "completion": "Using the 'or' operator with potentially undefined object properties could lead to errors in scenarios where the left operand is undefined and the right operand is not a valid value for the context. For example, if you are trying to access a property of an object that might not exist, using the 'or' operator could return a falsy value instead of the actual property value, leading to unexpected behavior."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Timestamps may be introduced by applying the datetime filter to properly formatted lists or to properly formatted strings.\nIs it possible to apply the datetime filter to a single item, or do I require a collection?", "completion": "The datetime filter in Blended requires a list of elements to convert into timestamps.

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: However, a variable set inside an if...else statement may only be accessed after that statement if the variable is guaranteed to have already been set. If a variable is used after an if...else statement, that variable MUST have been (a) defined before entering the if...else statement, or (b) defined in both the if section and the else section of the if...else statement. If a variable is set only in the if section, or only in the else section, without being defined earlier on within the same scope, then it will not be available after the if...else statement.\nIf a variable is initialized in both the if and else parts of an if-else statement and then used outside of these parts, what would be the result?", "completion": "Yes, it is valid since variable presence is guaranteed before usage."}

The for...else statement\u2019s 'iterator' scope persists for the duration of the tag\u2019s execution, and contains the named item variables and the forloop variable. The for...else statement\u2019s 'loop' scope is a child scope encapsulated by the 'iterator' scope. By this arrangement, the forloop variable and the named item variable(s) are prohibited from being modified inside the 'loop' scope.\nWhat are the effects of the 'iterator' scope's persistence in a Blended for...else statement?", "completion": "The 'iterator' scope's persistence allows for the named item variables and the forloop variable to be accessed and used throughout the tag's execution."}

{"prompt": "[code-task] Formulate a template to round the number 15.99 using the floor function and store the result in the variable 'rounded_price'. Lastly, output the value of 'rounded_price'.", "completion": "{% set rounded_price = floor(15.99) %} {% print rounded_price %}"}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The import tag adds a module to the current scope. The macros declared inside the imported file, and only those macros, are added as members of the module, accessible through dot notation. Because the imported template is independently evaluated by Blended-Lint prior to importation, it is ensured that all macros accessible via the module will be without conflict amongst themselves. All other contents of the imported template (including any variables set or macros or modules imported) are ignored and discarded upon import. Variable data (i.e. non-macro data) is not imported.\nIf I import a module that contains a variable with the same name as a variable in my current scope, what will be the result?", "completion": "In Blended, if a variable in the imported file has the same name as a variable in the current scope, the variable in the imported file will overwrite the variable in the current scope."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Usage of floor function in Blended : floor(10.5).\nHow can I apply the floor function in Blended?", "completion": "Floor function is used with integers like `floor(10.56)` , `floor(-19.54)`."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: In Jinja, ceil is a filter. In Blended, this filter has been converted into a built-in function named ceil, which takes a number as an argument and returns the ceil of the provided number.\nIs the ceil function a part of the Blended library?", "completion": "No, ceil is a built-in function in Blended and not macro."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Loop variables cannot be modified inside the for loop.\nIf I were to employ a loop variable to hold a value that serves as a temporary storage for intermediate outcomes?", "completion": "Yes, you can use a loop variable to store a value that is used to store intermediate results. For example, in a loop that calculates the factorial of a number, you can use a variable like `factorial` to store the intermediate results."}
