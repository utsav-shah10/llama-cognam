    The expression tag is a less-verbose alternative syntax for the print statement.  Unlike all named statement tags, its internal syntax does not begin with the tag name.  {{ <expression> }} is semantically equivalent to {% print <expression> %}.  The statement represented by an expression tag is a print statement.
