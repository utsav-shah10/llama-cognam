{"prompt": "What happens if I use the 'or' operator with a potentially undefined object property in Blended?", "completion": "In Blended, using the 'or' operator with a potentially undefined object property will result in a runtime error. This is because the 'or' operator in Blended is not designed to handle undefined values in the same way as it does in Jinja/Twig. Instead, it will evaluate the left operand and if it is truthy, it will return the left operand; otherwise, it will return the right operand. If the left operand is undefined, it will return the right operand, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."}
