Then, the contents, as-evaluated, are inserted into the template at the position of the block block declaration. Nested blocks are not evaluated at the position of their containing block, and do not have access to any element of any other block scope, even the scope of a containing block."}
{"prompt": "Can I use the keyword 'on' as a variable name in Blended?", "completion": "No, 'on' is a reserved keyword and cannot be used as a variable name."}

{"prompt": "What happens if a nested block is defined inside a parent block?", "completion": "The nested block is evaluated as a direct child of the template scope at the position of the outer-most containing block. Then, the contents, as-evaluated, are inserted into the template at the position of the block block declaration. Nested blocks are not evaluated at the position of their containing block, and do not have access to any element of any other block scope, even the scope of a containing block."}
{"prompt": "How does the 'Iterator' scope differ from other scopes in Blended?", "completion": "The 'Iterator' scope is distinct from other scopes in Blended because it is specifically designed to handle iteration objects within the 'for...else' block.

{"prompt": "How does the rule handle nested scopes, such as when a function or block is defined within another function or block?", "completion": "Nested scopes are supported, and data names defined within a nested scope are only accessible within that scope and its parent scopes. The rule does not allow access to data names from ancestor scopes unless explicitly passed as arguments."}

{"prompt": "What happens if a macro tries to access a variable that is not defined in its scope or passed as an argument?", "completion": "The macro will raise an error indicating that the variable is not defined."}
{"prompt": "What if a variable is defined in a parent scope and then a grandchild scope tries to redefine it?", "completion": "The grandchild scope will not be able to redefine the variable. It will be read-only and cannot be modified."}
{"prompt": "How does the scope affect access to data in Blended templates?", "completion": "Access to the data that statements operate upon is restricted by scope in Blended templates. This means that data can only be accessed within the scope in which it is defined."}

{"prompt": "Can I use a variable set at the bottom of a for loop in the else block?", "completion": "Yes, you can use a variable set at the bottom of a for loop in the else block because the else block is executed after the loop, and the loop scope is cleared upon each iteration."}
{"prompt": "What is the scope of the 'else' segment in a Blended for...else statement?", "completion": "The 'else' segment in a Blended for...else statement is a sibling of the 'iterator' scope and shares with it and the 'loop' scope whatever variables are defined in the scope that contains the for...else statement itself. It does not have access to the 'forloop' variable nor the named item variables from the 'iterator' scope."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between Blended and Jinja/Twig?", "completion": "Blended is a variant of Jinja/Twig with strict scoping and type casting rules. This means that Blended has additional features and restrictions compared to Jinja/Twig."}

However, this is not recommended as it can lead to confusion and potential bugs."}
{"prompt": "Can the 'Iterator' scope be used in other parts of the code besides the 'for...else' block?", "completion": "No, the 'Iterator' scope is specifically designed to be used within the 'for...else' block. It is not intended to be used in other parts of the code."}

{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the JSON file used to declare user-defined functions in Blended?", "completion": "The JSON file used to declare user-defined functions in Blended specifies each function\u2019s name, argument data types, and possible return types."}
{"prompt": "What if a variable is accessed in a tag or expression that is set in a user-function scope?", "completion": "The variable is still assumed to belong to the application scope."}
{"prompt": "How does the double evaluation affect the scope of variables within a block?", "completion": "The double evaluation of a block scope in Blended does not affect the scope of variables within the block.

{"prompt": "What happens if a variable is declared in a child scope and then accessed in a parent scope?", "completion": "In Blended, accessing a variable declared in a child scope from a parent scope is not allowed. This is because the current namespace consists of the current scope (read-write) and all parent and ancestor scopes (read-only)."}
{"prompt": "Can a block modify a variable declared in a another block?", "completion": "No, a block cannot modify a variable declared in a another block. The block's scope is independent, and it does not have access to modify variables in the another block."}
{"prompt": "What is the scope of the 'loop' in a Blended for...else statement?", "completion": "The 'loop' scope is a child scope encapsulated by the 'iterator' scope."}
{"prompt": "What if the master template has both schema-definition and user-function-definition files?", "completion": "The rule does not apply in this case."}
