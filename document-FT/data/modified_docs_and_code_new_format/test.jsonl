{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: An included template shares the 'built-in' scope and the 'user-function' scope of the template from which it has been referenced (i.e. the master template). The 'application' scope of the included template varies depending on whether or not the only keyword is present inside the include tag. If the only keyword is present, then the 'application' scope of the included template is populated only by the dictionary passed in using the with keyword (if present). If the only keyword is missing, then the 'application' scope for the included template is populated by the master template\u2019s entire namespace at the point of the include template\u2019s evaluation, optionally updated and overwritten by the contents of the dictionary passed into the import tag using the with keyword. Below the level of the 'application' scope (starting with the 'template' scope), each imported template is to be analyzed as per the rules described herein, as if it were a standalone template.\nWhat would happen if the sole keyword is present in the include tag?", "completion": "If the only keyword is present in the include tag, the 'application' scope of the included template is populated only by the dictionary passed in using the with keyword."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The 'template' scope is the scope of all variables, macros and modules defined inside the root template, outside of all macro tags, block tags, and for...else statements.\nIf a macro defines a variable and that variable is then utilized within a block tag, what outcomes can be expected?", "completion": "The variable is not accessible in the block tag, as it is defined in the macro scope."}
{"prompt": "[code-task] Transform the figure of zero", "completion": "{{ 0 }}"}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Macros are added to a scope via the macro tag, or the from...import tag.\nCan macros be utilized to implement loops or conditional statements in Blended?", "completion": "Yes, macros can be used to create loops or conditional statements by defining them with the appropriate logic."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: If no schema-definition or user-function-definition files are provided for the master template--and by implication if the application scope is to be dynamically calculated for the master template--then the application scope expectation of the included template is accreted to the application scope of the master template.\nIf the template lacks a schema-definition or user-function-definition file, what would be the consequence?", "completion": "The application scope expectation of the included template is accreted to the application scope of the master template."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Some block statement contents will be evaluated by Blended-Lint yet again if invoked by a parent tag inside a child block. If any 'block' scope contains a parent tag, then the closest ancestor to contain a block statement with the same name is found, and that block is evaluated as a child of the original 'block' scope at the position of the parent tag. If, however, no parent block statement is found, then the parent tag is ignored.\nWhat would occur if a block statement is initiated by a parent tag within a child block, and the parent block has multiple block statements with the same name?", "completion": "The closest ancestor block with the same name is evaluated as a child of the original block scope."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Access to the data that statements operate upon is restricted by scope. Nine (9) types of scope are defined for Blended templates : Built-in, User-function, Render, Template, Macro, Block, Iterator, Loop, Else.\nI've been told that there are 10 different scopes in blended. Is this accurate?", "completion": "No, there are 9 types of scopes present in blended."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: If no schema-definition or user-function-definition files are provided for the master template--and by implication if the application scope is to be dynamically calculated for the master template--then the application scope expectation of the included template is accreted to the application scope of the master template.\nIn the absence of a schema-definition or user-function-definition file in the template, what would be the outcome?", "completion": "The application scope expectation of the included template is accreted to the application scope of the master template."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: User-defined functions inhabit the second-level scope, the 'user-function' scope, which is the child of the 'built-in' scope. As follows from the rules above, no user-defined function may share the name of any built-in function, nor may any template-defined macro, variable or imported module share the name of any user-defined function. For purposes of Blended-Lint, user-defined functions are declared in a specifically-formatted JSON file that specifies each function\u2019s name, argument data types, and possible return types.\nIn Blended, how do you define a custom function?", "completion": "A user-defined function is declared in a specifically-formatted JSON file that specifies each function\u2019s name, argument data types, and possible return types."}

Verbatim statement's code segment must not contain {% endverbatim %}\nCould I use `{% raw %}` and `{% endraw %}` in a Blended template to include HTML or other non-Jinja/Twig content?", "completion": "Yes, you can use `{% raw %}` and `{% endraw %}` in a Blended template to include HTML or other non-Jinja/Twig content. These tags allow you to include raw HTML or other content without it being interpreted as Jinja/Twig syntax."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: string filter: argument should be string or nothing. It converts blended objects to string.\nCould the string filter be utilized with non-string objects?", "completion": "Yes it can be used with non-string objects just like Jinja string filter."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The order in which Blended-Lint evaluates blocks is important. First, all referenced templates are evaluated separately, including the root template. Then, the root template is evaluated, with each block being replaced by the block with the same name that is defined in the furthest descendant template.\nWhat strategies does Blended-Lint employ when dealing with multiple blocks defined in the same template?", "completion": "The block is replaced by the block with the same name that is defined in the furthest descendant template."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: No data names used in any parent or ancestor scope may be modified or overridden within any child or descendant scope--they are read-only within the child or descendant scope. This means that names in use by the parent scope (or in any ancestor scope) may not be used as a target for set, as a macro name, as a name for a module imported using the import tag, or as an iteration item in the for tag.

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Any variable name that is referenced or accessed within the body of a template, but which has not been declared within the body of the template, should be assumed to have been introduced within the application scope. However, a JSON schema document may be provided to Blended-Lint which declares all of the application variables for a given template file. In the case that such a schema file is provided, any variable name that is referenced or accessed within the body of a template which has neither been declared within the body of the template nor declared within the JSON schema document shall be deemed an error ('variable undefined'), causing the file to be declared invalid.\nIs it feasible to declare a variable within the template and then utilize it later?", "completion": "Yes, as long as it is declared within the template or the JSON schema."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Macros can make recursive calls to themselves, but circular calls between and among macros is prohibited.\nWhat is the impact of a macro that repeatedly calls itself without using recursion?", "completion": "A macro calling itself in a non-recursive manner is allowed and does not violate the rule."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Nested blocks are treated in much the same way that parent blocks are. They are evaluated as direct children of the template scope at the position of the outer-most containing block. Then, the contents, as-evaluated, are inserted into the template at the position of the block block declaration. Nested blocks are not evaluated at the position of their containing block, and do not have access to any element of any other block scope, even the scope of a containing block.\nWhat happens when a block is contained within another block?", "completion": "The nested block is evaluated as a direct child of the template scope at the position of the outer-most containing block.

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: In Jinja, lower, upper, length, mean, rgbcolor, title, truncate, ceil, floor, join, and concat are filters. In Blended, all these filters have been converted into built-in functions. Each of them is now called as a function (e.g., lower('HELLO')) and not used as filters.\nCan I apply 'upper' as a filter in Blended?", "completion": "No, 'upper' is a filter in Jinja and a function in Blended. So cannot be used as filter in Blended."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Loop variables cannot be modified inside the for loop.\nHow can I maintain a cumulative total during the execution of a loop?", "completion": "You can use a loop variable to keep track of a running total within a loop. For example, in a loop that sums up numbers, you can use a variable like `total` to accumulate the sum."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Verbatim statement's code segment must not contain {% endraw %}. Verbatim statement's code segment must not contain {% endverbatim %}\nWhat is the role of the rule that prevents the inclusion of `{% endraw %}` and `{% endverbatim %}` in Blended?", "completion": "The rule is designed to ensure that the code within verbatim statements in Blended is not mistakenly interpreted as Jinja/Twig syntax, which could lead to syntax errors or unexpected behavior."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Statements' may consist of individual tags (for instance, the 'set' statement), or they may be comprised of multiple tags (for instance, the 'if' and 'for' statements).\nIs it possible to embed a statement within another statement in Blended?", "completion": "Yes, a statement in Blended can be nested within another statement, allowing for complex logic and structure."}
