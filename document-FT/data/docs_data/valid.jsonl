{"prompt": "Can a macro be defined directly within the scope of a block statement?", "completion": "Yes, macro tags may only be used directly within the scope of a block statement."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a macro in Blended shares the name of a variable defined in the same scope?", "completion": "The macro will not be defined, and we will get an error from the compiler"}
{"prompt": "What is the relationship between the 'else' segment and the 'iterator' scope in terms of variable access?", "completion": "The 'else' segment is a sibling of the 'iterator' scope and shares with it and the 'loop' scope whatever variables are defined in the scope that contains the for...else statement itself. It does not have access to the 'forloop' variable nor the named item variables from the 'iterator' scope."}
{"prompt": "Can a macro in Blended access outside variables directly?", "completion": "No, a macro in Blended can only access outside variables directly if they are passed in as arguments."}
{"prompt": "Can the else section of a for...else block be used with other control structures like if...else?", "completion": "Yes, the else section of a for...else block can be used with other control structures like if...else. However, the else section of a for...else block will only execute if the for loop is not executed due to a condition outside the loop."}
{"prompt": "What is the scope of a macro in Blended?", "completion": "In Blended, the scope of a macro is limited to the template code that is enclosed within the macro tags."}
