{"prompt": "Could I incorporate a module that includes a variable with the same name as a macro in the current context?", "completion": "Yes, in Blended, a module can contain a variable with the same name as a macro in the current scope. The variable will not overwrite the macro."}
{"prompt": "Define a block named 'alerts' and print the variable 'alert_message' if it is defined", "completion": "{% block alerts %}{% if alert_message %}{{ alert_message }}{% endif %}{% endblock %}"}
{"prompt": "If a block is defined within another block, what happens?", "completion": "The nested block is evaluated as a direct child of the template scope at the position of the outer-most containing block. Then, the contents, as-evaluated, are inserted into the template at the position of the block block declaration. Nested blocks are not evaluated at the position of their containing block, and do not have access to any element of any other block scope, even the scope of a containing block."}

{"prompt": "Which key components should be considered when crafting a valid blended template?", "completion": "For someone whose only objective is to write Blended-compatible templates for their website, knowing the below four points should be sufficient. Inside a macro, you can also import macros from other files, but the only way that a macro can get access to outside variables is for them to be passed in as arguments. Names defined inside parent or ancestor scopes are available for use within child or descendant scopes, but not vice-versa; Names defined inside parent or ancestor scopes cannot be overwritten or modified within child or descendant scopes--they are read-only; Names defined inside a scope are unavailable after the scope exits--they are local to that scope; Macros are different: the only external objects automatically accessible from inside a macro are built-in functions, user functions, and whatever other macros were defined inside the same scope."}
{"prompt": "I declared a variable inside a for loop and then tried to use it outside of it. I got an error, could you explain why?", "completion": "It is because variables declared inside a scope are unavailable after scope exits and thus cannot be used. "}
{"prompt": "The ability of macros to make recursive calls to themselves is undeniable, but they cannot perform circular calls. Is this assertion correct?", "completion": "TRUE"}
{"prompt": "Convert the variable 'module_name' to uppercase, then set the variable 'module_label' to 'MODULE: ' concatenated with the result, and finally print it.", "completion": "{% set module_label = 'MODULE: ' ~ upper(module_name) %} {% print module_label %}"}

{"prompt": "What would occur if I were to use the 'or' operator with a potentially undefined property in Blended?", "completion": "In Blended, using the 'or' operator with a potentially undefined object property will result in a runtime error. This is because the 'or' operator in Blended is not designed to handle undefined values in the same way as it does in Jinja/Twig. Instead, it will evaluate the left operand and if it is truthy, it will return the left operand; otherwise, it will return the right operand. If the left operand is undefined, it will return the right operand, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."}

{"prompt": "If I attempt to access a property that doesn't exist within an object, what will happen?", "completion": "In Blended, attempting to access a property that doesn't exist in an object will result in an error. For example, if you try to access `{{x.c}}` where `x` is an object that doesn't have a key `c`, the code will fail."}
{"prompt": "Why is it that I cannot directly apply '{{x.b}}'?", "completion": "It may be possible that object 'x' doesn't has the key 'b'. So, it is always better to keep a check."}
{"prompt": "Is it feasible to access a variable that is defined in a neighboring scope?", "completion": "No, a variable cannot be accessed if it is defined in a sibling scope."}
