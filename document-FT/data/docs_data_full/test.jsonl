{"prompt": "How does the imported template file interact with the current namespace?", "completion": "The imported template file is evaluated without having any reference to the current namespace that contains the tag."}
{"prompt": "How do `loop.first` and `loop.last` behave in a for loop?", "completion": "In a for loop, `loop.first` is `true` for the first iteration and `false` for all subsequent iterations. `loop.last` is `true` for the last iteration and `false` for all other iterations."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the template filter in Blended?", "completion": "The template filter in Blended is used to compile a string into a template object, allowing for the introduction of templates within the language."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the `rgbcolor` function in Blended?", "completion": "The `rgbcolor` function in Blended is used to generate a color value in the RGB color model. It can take either a hexadecimal string or an array of three integers representing the red, green, and blue components of the color."}

{"prompt": "What happens if the argument is a number in the string filter?", "completion": "If the argument is a number in the string filter, it will convert the number to a string. This is because the filter is designed to handle any object and convert it to a string, and if the argument is a number, it will be converted to a string representation."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a variable is defined in multiple blocks?", "completion": "Since all blocks have their independent scope, this variable will be unique in each block."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a nested block is defined inside another nested block?", "completion": "The nested block is evaluated as a direct child of the template scope at the position of the outer-most containing block. Then, the contents, as-evaluated, are inserted into the template at the position of the block block declaration. Nested blocks are not evaluated at the position of their containing block, and do not have access to any element of any other block scope, even the scope of a containing block."}
{"prompt": "What if the included template does not have a schema-definition or user-function-definition file?", "completion": "The application scope expectation of the included template is accreted to the application scope of the master template."}
{"prompt": "Can a macro in Blended import macros from other files?", "completion": "Yes, a macro in Blended can import macros from other files."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the Else scope in Blended templates?", "completion": "The Else scope is used to define the code that should be executed if the condition in a conditional statement is not met."}

{"prompt": "What happens if the input to the `items` filter is not a dictionary?", "completion": "If the input to the `items` filter is not a dictionary, it will result in an error or an unexpected output, as the filter is not designed to handle non-dictionary inputs."}
{"prompt": "List 5 built-in functions in Blended", "completion": "Here are the five built in functions in Blended : lower, upper, length, mean, rgbcolor etc."}

{"prompt": "What happens if a code segment is not used in any statement in Blended?", "completion": "If a code segment is not used in any statement in Blended, it will not be rendered and will not have any effect on the output."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a variable is declared in a child scope and then accessed in a sibling scope?", "completion": "In Blended, accessing a variable declared in a child scope from a sibling scope is not allowed. This is because the current namespace consists of the current scope (read-write) and all parent and ancestor scopes (read-only)."}
{"prompt": "Is upper function of Jinja function in Blended?", "completion": "No, upper function of Jinja is converted to built-in function of Blended."}

{"prompt": "What if I want to access a property that is a function and I want to call it?", "completion": "You can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses. For example, if you have a function `myFunction` and you want to call it, you can do so by using `{{myFunction()}}`."}
{"prompt": "Can the concat function handle arrays of different data types in Blended?", "completion": "Yes, the concat function in Blended can handle arrays of different data types. It will concatenate the arrays based on their elements, but the resulting array will contain elements of the same data type as the first array."}
{"prompt": "What happens if I import a module that contains a variable with the same name as a variable in the current scope?", "completion": "In Blended, if a variable in the imported file has the same name as a variable in the current scope, the variable in the imported file will overwrite the variable in the current scope."}
{"prompt": "Can I use a for loop to iterate over a list and modify the list at the same time?", "completion": "No, you cannot modify the list while iterating over it using a for loop in Blended. This rule prevents accidental changes to the list that could disrupt the loop's execution."}
