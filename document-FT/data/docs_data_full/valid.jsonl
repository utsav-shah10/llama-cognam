{"prompt": "Can the mean function be used in a loop or conditional statement?", "completion": "Yes, the mean function can be used in loops or conditional statements in Blended. For example, you can calculate the mean of a list of numbers within a loop to find the average of multiple sets of data."}
{"prompt": "How do I use the `rgbcolor` function with an array of integers?", "completion": "To use the `rgbcolor` function with an array of integers, you pass the array as an argument. For example, `rgbcolor([1, 2, 3])` will generate a color with red component 1, green component 2, and blue component 3."}
{"prompt": "Are names assigned in the template accessible outside the template?", "completion": "I don't have information about this scope yet. "}
{"prompt": "How does the title function work with punctuation?", "completion": "The title function in Blended does not alter punctuation. It capitalizes the first letter of each word and leaves punctuation marks in their original positions."}
{"prompt": "What is the scope of the 'iterator' in a Blended for...else statement?", "completion": "The 'iterator' scope persists for the duration of the tag's execution and contains the named item variables and the forloop variable."}
{"prompt": "How does this rule affect the dynamic calculation of the application scope for the master template?", "completion": "If the application scope is to be dynamically calculated for the master template, then the rule applies."}
{"prompt": "If a child template defines a block that is not found in the root or any ancestor, how many times will that block be evaluated?", "completion": "Only the first evaluation will be made."}
{"prompt": "What is the datetime filter in Blended?", "completion": "The datetime filter in Blended is a built-in function that converts a properly formatted list or string into a timestamp."}
{"prompt": "How to find the length of a string 'str'? ", "completion": "The length of a string 'str' can be found using length function of blended as length(str). "}
{"prompt": "How does the inclusion of a template with only the 'IS USED' keyword affect the scope comparison?", "completion": "If the only keyword used in the include tag is 'IS USED', the included template's application scope expectation is only compared to whatever values are supplied using the include tag's 'with' argument, to determine if they are sufficient."}
{"prompt": "How does the `from...import` tag work in Blended?", "completion": "The `from...import` tag is used to import macros from other files or modules into the current scope."}
{"prompt": "What if I need to iterate over a dictionary and modify its values based on some condition?", "completion": "To modify dictionary values while iterating over it, you can use a for loop with the `items()` method. This method allows you to iterate over the dictionary's key-value pairs and make changes to the values based on conditions without violating the rule."}
{"prompt": "How are templates added to the scope?", "completion": "Templates are added to the scope through transformations performed on core variable types via filters."}
{"prompt": "Can I define a function that has the same name as a variable in my code?", "completion": "No, you cannot. In Blended, functions are provided by the environment and cannot be overridden. Therefore, defining a function with the same name as a variable will result in an error."}
{"prompt": "What are some common scenarios where using the 'or' operator with potentially undefined object properties could lead to errors?", "completion": "Using the 'or' operator with potentially undefined object properties could lead to errors in scenarios where the left operand is undefined and the right operand is not a valid value for the context. For example, if you are trying to access a property of an object that might not exist, using the 'or' operator could return a falsy value instead of the actual property value, leading to unexpected behavior."}
{"prompt": "Can I use the keyword 'off' as a variable name in Blended?", "completion": "No, 'off' is a reserved keyword and cannot be used as a variable name."}
{"prompt": "Is the `title` function case-sensitive?", "completion": "No, the `title` function is case-insensitive. It will capitalize the first letter of each word regardless of the case of the original string."}
{"prompt": "What is the syntax for rendering a string in Blended?", "completion": "In Blended, you can render a string using the syntax `{{ 'hello' }}`. This will output the string 'hello' directly."}
{"prompt": "Can a macro import a macro that is defined in a different scope but not imported by any macro in the same scope?", "completion": "Yes, a macro can import a macro that is defined in a different scope but not imported by any macro in the same scope."}
