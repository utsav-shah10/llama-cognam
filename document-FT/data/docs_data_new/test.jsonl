{"prompt": "Can a variable be declared inside scope A and used in scope B?", "completion": "No, variable declared inside scope A can be used in scope A only and not in any other scope"}
{"prompt": "Can a variable be accessed if it is defined in an ancestor scope?", "completion": "Yes, a variable can be accessed if it is defined in an ancestor scope."}
{"prompt": "How does the order of evaluation of block scope instances in Blended happens?", "completion": "The order of evaluation of block scope instances in Blended is determined by the order in which they are defined in the template. In root templates, the order is determined by the order of the block scope instances in the template. In child templates, the order is determined by the order of the block scope instances in the template that extends it."}
{"prompt": "What if a function is called in a tag or expression that is declared in a user-function scope?", "completion": "The function is still assumed to be a function belonging to the user-function scope."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the double evaluation of a block scope in Blended?", "completion": "The double evaluation of a block scope in Blended is to ensure that the block is evaluated in two different contexts: once as a child of the render scope and once as a child of the root template's template scope. This allows for more flexible and dynamic template rendering."}
{"prompt": "Are names assigned in the template accessible outside the template?", "completion": "I don't have information about this scope yet. "}
{"prompt": "What are the strict scoping rules in Blended?", "completion": "In Blended, variables are scoped to the block in which they are defined. This means that variables declared within a block are not accessible outside of that block."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a block is not defined in the root template?", "completion": "If a block is not defined in the root template, it will not be evaluated in the second context. Instead, the block will be evaluated only once as a child of the render scope."}
{"prompt": "Can a variable be declared within the template and then referenced later?", "completion": "Yes, as long as it is declared within the template or the JSON schema."}
{"prompt": "What is the 'application' scope in Blended?", "completion": "The 'application' scope is populated by the master template's entire namespace at the point of the include template's evaluation, optionally updated and overwritten by the contents of the dictionary passed into the import tag using the with keyword."}

{"prompt": "What is included in Render scope?", "completion": "It has data provided by application at time of 'render' invocation"}
{"prompt": "Can the else section of a for...else block be empty?", "completion": "Yes, the else section of a for...else block can be empty. If there are no items in the list, the else section will not execute any code."}
{"prompt": "What if a data name is defined in a tag or expression and then used in another tag or expression within the same scope?", "completion": "The data name can be used in another tag or expression within the same scope, as long as it has been defined within that scope or within a parent or ancestor scope."}
{"prompt": "How does Blended-Lint ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in the same way regardless of the runtime?", "completion": "Blended-Lint constructs rules to ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in exactly the same way regardless of what Blended-compatible runtime is used."}

{"prompt": "What are the three pairs of delimiters used to distinguish tags from static text in Blended?", "completion": "The three pairs of delimiters used to distinguish tags from static text in Blended are {% and %}, {{ and }}, and {# and #}."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'else' block in a 'for...else' block in Blended?", "completion": "The 'else' block in a 'for...else' block in Blended is used to execute code when the loop completes without finding any items to iterate over."}
{"prompt": "What are the delimiters used for comment tags in Blended?", "completion": "Comment tags use the \u201c{#\u201d and \u201c#}\u201d delimiters."}
{"prompt": "What is the scope of the 'Application' scope in Blended?", "completion": "The 'Application' scope is the child of the 'user-function' scope and is the parent of the template scope."}
{"prompt": "Can a block statement be invoked by a parent tag inside a child block if the parent block contains a block statement with the same name?", "completion": "Yes, the closest ancestor block with the same name is evaluated as a child of the original block scope."}
{"prompt": "Can names defined inside parent or ancestor scopes be overwritten or modified within child or descendant scopes?", "completion": "No, names defined inside parent or ancestor scopes cannot be overwritten or modified within child or descendant scopes."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of macros in Blended templates?", "completion": "Macros in Blended templates are reusable blocks of code that can be called multiple times within a template. They are useful for creating complex logic and reducing redundancy."}
{"prompt": "Can variables be added to the scope as part of the application-provided context?", "completion": "Yes, variables can be added to the scope as part of the application-provided context."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the `items` filter in Blended?", "completion": "The `items` filter in Blended is used to extract key-value pairs from a dictionary object and present them as a list of pairs."}
{"prompt": "What happens if the for loop is executed but the else section is not executed?", "completion": "In Blended, if the for loop is executed but the else section is not executed, it means that the for loop iterated over all items in the list and the else section was not triggered."}
{"prompt": "What happens if I try to define a function with the same name as a built-in function in Blended?", "completion": "Attempting to define a function with the same name as a built-in function in Blended will result in a syntax error. The language specification explicitly prohibits this to maintain clarity and prevent conflicts with built-in functionality."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a code segment is not used in any statement in Blended?", "completion": "If a code segment is not used in any statement in Blended, it will not be rendered and will not have any effect on the output."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a variable is defined in a parent scope and then a child scope tries to redefine it?", "completion": "The child scope will not be able to redefine the variable as multiple declarations are not allowed in Blended."}
{"prompt": "Can macros access built-in functions, user functions, and other macros defined inside the same scope?", "completion": "Yes, the only external objects automatically accessible from inside a macro are built-in functions, user functions, and whatever other macros were defined inside the same scope."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the escape filter in Blended?", "completion": "The escape filter in Blended is used to introduce escaped strings into the code, which helps prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks by converting special characters into their HTML entity equivalents."}
{"prompt": "Can variables defined in the 'Application' scope be accessed in nested templates?", "completion": "Yes, variables defined in the 'Application' scope are accessible in nested templates."}
{"prompt": "What are the derived variable types in Blended?", "completion": "The derived variable types in Blended are Pair lists, timestamps, templates, safe strings, and escaped strings.

{"prompt": "Can I use the keyword 'off' as a variable name in Blended?", "completion": "No, 'off' is a reserved keyword and cannot be used as a variable name."}
{"prompt": "Can a user-defined function have the same name as a built-in function in Blended?", "completion": "No, a user-defined function cannot have the same name as a built-in function in Blended."}
{"prompt": "What happens if the only keyword is missing in the include tag?", "completion": "If the only keyword is missing in the include tag, the 'application' scope for the included template is populated by the master template\u2019s entire namespace at the point of the include template\u2019s evaluation, optionally updated and overwritten by the contents of the dictionary passed into the import tag using the with keyword."}
{"prompt": "Can a macro be defined inside an if...else statement?", "completion": "No, the macro statement may not appear inside an if...else statement."}
{"prompt": "How does the `items` filter work with dictionaries?", "completion": "The `items` filter takes a dictionary object as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary."}
{"prompt": "Can a user-defined function have the same name as a template-defined macro, variable, or imported module in Blended?", "completion": "No, a user-defined function cannot have the same name as a template-defined macro, variable, or imported module in Blended."}
{"prompt": "What is the significance of the prescribed behavior of a statement in Blended?", "completion": "The prescribed behavior of a statement in Blended determines how a code segment is rendered. This behavior is defined by the statement to which the code segment belongs."}
{"prompt": "Can a macro in Blended share the name of a class defined in the same scope?", "completion": "The macro will not be defined, and we will get an error from the compiler"}
{"prompt": "How does the imported template file interact with the current namespace?", "completion": "The imported template file is evaluated without having any reference to the current namespace that contains the tag."}
{"prompt": "Can names assigned in the template be accessed within blocks?", "completion": "I don't have information about this scope yet. "}
{"prompt": "Can strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries be added to the scope as literal values passed in as input to a tag?", "completion": "Yes, strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries can be added to the scope as literal values passed in as input to a tag."}
{"prompt": "How does Blended handle data that is not provided at the time of rendering?", "completion": "Blended will raise an error if a template attempts to access data that is not provided at the time of rendering."}
{"prompt": "What happens if a named statement tag is immediately followed by a newline character in a Blended template?", "completion": "The newline character is removed from the template, except for endverbatim tags."}
{"prompt": "How does a macro handle variable scope within its own block?", "completion": "A macro in Blended handles variable scope within its own block by creating a new scope for variables defined within the macro tags."}
{"prompt": "What happens to variables set inside a for loop in Twig?", "completion": "In Twig, variables set inside a for loop persist after the loop ends, unlike in Jinja where they fall out of scope when the loop terminates."}
{"prompt": "Can custom functions be used in any part of the Blended code?", "completion": "Custom functions can be used in any part of the Blended code, but they are not part of the language's built-in functionality."}
