{"prompt": "If I aim to improve the functionality of a built-in function within Blended?", "completion": "In Blended, functions are provided by the environment and cannot be overridden. Therefore, you cannot extend the functionality of a built-in function."}
{"prompt": "What are the distinctions between block scope in root templates and child templates within Blended?", "completion": "In root templates, instances of the block scope are always evaluated as children of the template scope that contains it.

{"prompt": "Is it possible to employ a variable initialized at the bottom of a for loop in the else block?", "completion": "Yes, you can use a variable set at the bottom of a for loop in the else block because the else block is executed after the loop, and the loop scope is cleared upon each iteration."}
