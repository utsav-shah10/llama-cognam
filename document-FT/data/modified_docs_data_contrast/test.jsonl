This rule ensures that the loop's control variables remain constant, preventing unintended side effects."}
{"prompt": "If you attempt to use `ifblock` without first defining the block, what will happen?", "completion": "Using `ifblock` without defining the block first will result in an error because the block must be defined before the `ifblock` check."}
{"prompt": "Does the built-in scope include user-defined functions?", "completion": "No, built-in scope only contains the built-in functions provided by blended. "}
{"prompt": "Determine the five essential functions included in Blended", "completion": "Here are the five built in functions in Blended : lower, upper, length, mean, rgbcolor etc."}

{"prompt": "Can you explain the difference between a circular call and a recursive call?", "completion": "Recursive call means that macro calling itself, while circular call mean macro A calling macro B and macro B calling macro A. It is a circular loop and hence not allowed. "}
{"prompt": "What happens if a macro from an imported file has the same name as a macro in the current scope?", "completion": "In Blended, if a macro in the imported file has the same name as a macro in the current scope, the macro in the imported file will overwrite the macro in the current scope."}

{"prompt": "Is it possible to define a function with the same name as a variable in my programming code?", "completion": "No, you cannot. In Blended, functions are provided by the environment and cannot be overridden. Therefore, defining a function with the same name as a variable will result in an error."}

{"prompt": "Can a macro be embedded within a macro tag that is itself contained within another macro tag?", "completion": "Yes, defining a macro using a macro tag inside of another macro tag is permitted."}
{"prompt": "What is the effect of adding a template with only the 'IS USED' keyword on the scope comparison?", "completion": "If the only keyword used in the include tag is 'IS USED', the included template's application scope expectation is only compared to whatever values are supplied using the include tag's 'with' argument, to determine if they are sufficient."}
{"prompt": "Can the scope of the application template be changed by the master template?", "completion": "No, the application scope of the included template is accreted to the application scope of the master template."}
{"prompt": "The ability of macros to make recursive calls to themselves is undeniable, but they cannot perform circular calls. Is this assertion correct?", "completion": "TRUE"}
{"prompt": "What happens when a Print statement is executed with a type that is not supported?", "completion": "A syntax error will occur, as Print statements in Blended only accept string or number types."}
{"prompt": "Can the escape filter be used on variables or only on string values?", "completion": "The escape filter can be applied to both strings and variables. It is typically used on strings to ensure that any special characters are properly encoded."}
{"prompt": "In the context of a Blended for...else statement, what is the extent of the 'else' segment?", "completion": "The 'else' segment in a Blended for...else statement is a sibling of the 'iterator' scope and shares with it and the 'loop' scope whatever variables are defined in the scope that contains the for...else statement itself. It does not have access to the 'forloop' variable nor the named item variables from the 'iterator' scope."}
{"prompt": "Why is the 'and' operator allowed to be used with x.b?", "completion": "x.b is allowed to be used with 'and' operator only because, it ensures that the property 'b' of object 'x' exists before usage. "}
{"prompt": "Can variables be incorporated into the scope as a transformation applied to other variable data through filters?", "completion": "Yes, variables can be added to the scope as a transformation performed on other variable data via filters."}
{"prompt": "We define tags that utilize '{%' and '%}' as delimiters as unnamed tags. Is this accurate?", "completion": "No, we refer tags which uses  '{%' and '%}' as delimiters as named tags and not as unnamed tags. "}
{"prompt": "I've been informed that there are 10 distinct scopes in blended. Is this true?", "completion": "No, there are 9 types of scopes present in blended."}
{"prompt": "What are the acceptable values for the red, green, and blue components in the `rgbcolor` function?", "completion": "The red, green, and blue components in the `rgbcolor` function must be integers between 0 and 255, inclusive."}
{"prompt": "How does the 'Iterator' scope stand out from other scopes in the Blended platform?", "completion": "The 'Iterator' scope is distinct from other scopes in Blended because it is specifically designed to handle iteration objects within the 'for...else' block. This ensures that the iterator is properly managed and does not affect other parts of the code."}
{"prompt": "Can you explain how to use the `rgbcolor` function with a hexadecimal string?", "completion": "To use the `rgbcolor` function with a hexadecimal string, you pass the string as an argument. For example, `rgbcolor('#ffffff')` will generate the color white."}
{"prompt": "What is the range of the 'else' clause within a Blended for...else construct?", "completion": "The 'else' segment in a Blended for...else statement is a sibling of the 'iterator' scope and shares with it and the 'loop' scope whatever variables are defined in the scope that contains the for...else statement itself. It does not have access to the 'forloop' variable nor the named item variables from the 'iterator' scope."}
{"prompt": "Is it permissible to give a variable the name 'truncate'? ", "completion": "No, you cannot name a variable 'truncate' because 'truncate' is a built-in function and so it cannot share a name with a variable or anything else. "}
{"prompt": "In the realm of Blended, can macros be declared at the global level?", "completion": "No, macros can only be defined within a specific scope, either by using the `macro` tag or the `from...import` tag."}

{"prompt": "Does Blended provide a built-in string filter function?", "completion": "No, it is not a built-in function in Blended. It is built-in filter."}
{"prompt": "Could I create a variable named 'mean' within my integrated system?", "completion": "No, you cannot declare a anything named 'mean' in blended program because 'mean' is a built-in function in blended and hence cannot be override. "}

{"prompt": "What would occur if a block statement is initiated by a parent tag within a child block, and the parent block does not contain a block statement with the same name?", "completion": "The parent tag is ignored."}
{"prompt": "What are the implications of the 'Application' scope being constant and universal?", "completion": "Variables defined in the 'Application' scope are accessible inside all templates and tags, but no such variable may be modified or overwritten in any template by any tag."}
{"prompt": "How does Blended-Lint ensure that a valid Blended template consistently executes the same way across various runtime platforms?", "completion": "Blended-Lint constructs rules to ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in exactly the same way regardless of what Blended-compatible runtime is used."}
{"prompt": "What is the date and time selection feature in Blended?", "completion": "The datetime filter in Blended is a built-in function that converts a properly formatted list or string into a timestamp."}
{"prompt": "If a macro were to import another macro that is defined within the same scope but not imported by any other macro in the same scope, what would be the implications?", "completion": "The macro from the same scope is not accessible within the macro that imports it."}
{"prompt": "How can I properly structure a list to apply the datetime filter?", "completion": "To properly format a list for use with the datetime filter, ensure that the list contains elements that can be converted into a timestamp, such as dates or times."}
{"prompt": "What are the steps to correctly format a list for datetime filtering?", "completion": "To properly format a list for use with the datetime filter, ensure that the list contains elements that can be converted into a timestamp, such as dates or times."}
