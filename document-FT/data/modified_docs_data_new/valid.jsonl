{"prompt": "What is the effect of double evaluation on the scope of variables within a block?", "completion": "The double evaluation of a block scope in Blended does not affect the scope of variables within the block. Variables are scoped to the block itself, and their values are not shared between the two evaluations."}
{"prompt": "Can comments be nested within Blended?", "completion": "Yes, comments can be nested in Blended. You can place one comment inside another."}
{"prompt": "Can macros access variables defined in a different scope?", "completion": "No, macros can only access variables defined inside their scope or those explicitly passed as arguments."}
{"prompt": "What are the distinctions in the scope of Blended templates from Jinja/Twig?", "completion": "Blended templates have strict scoping rules, which differ from Jinja/Twig. In Blended, access to the data that statements operate upon is restricted by scope, and there are nine types of scope defined."}
{"prompt": "Is it allowed for macros to recursively call each other?", "completion": "No, circular calls between and among macros are prohibited."}
{"prompt": "What will be the outcome if I apply the escape filter to a string that is already escaped?", "completion": "If a string is already escaped, applying the escape filter again will not change its content. The string will remain in its escaped form."}
{"prompt": "What is the primary function of statements in Blended?", "completion": "Statements in Blended are the control structures that operate on the context and its data, contributing to the final rendered output of a template."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the Else statement in Blended templates?", "completion": "The Else scope is used to define the code that should be executed if the condition in a conditional statement is not met."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to incorporate a module that contains a variable with the same name as a macro in the current scope?", "completion": "Yes, in Blended, a module can contain a variable with the same name as a macro in the current scope. The variable will not overwrite the macro."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible for the 'else' part to access named item variables from the 'iterator' context?", "completion": "No, the 'else' segment does not have access to named item variables from the 'iterator' scope."}
{"prompt": "What are the differences between named tags and expression tags in the Blended platform?", "completion": "Named tags are used to define variables or blocks of code, while expression tags are used to evaluate expressions and insert their results into the output."}
{"prompt": "What is the role of a named tag in Blended?", "completion": "A named tag in Blended begins its internal syntax with a name that identifies its purpose."}
{"prompt": "How do statements affect the context in Blended?", "completion": "Statements in Blended interact with the context by accessing and modifying its data, which is essential for controlling the flow and content of the rendered output."}
{"prompt": "Can variables defined in the 'Application' scope be accessed in nested templates?", "completion": "Yes, variables defined in the 'Application' scope are accessible in nested templates."}
{"prompt": "What will happen if a template does not contain a schema-definition or user-function-definition file?", "completion": "If a template does not have a schema-definition or user-function-definition file, its application scope expectation is defined as all of the 'application' and 'user-function' scoped values consumed and required by that template in its execution."}
{"prompt": "Can functions defined within a block be invoked from outside the block?", "completion": "No, functions defined in a block are not accessible outside of that block. They are scoped to the block and are only available within the block's context."}
{"prompt": "What will occur if I add a template that contains variables that are not defined in the master template?", "completion": "The included template will not render those variables, and they will not affect the scope of the master template."}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits of employing the template filter in Blended?", "completion": "The template filter provides a way to compile strings into template objects, enabling the creation and manipulation of templates within the language, which can be useful for dynamic content generation and templating."}
{"prompt": "Can a module be imported multiple times in the same scope?", "completion": "No, a module cannot be imported multiple times in the same scope. Each import adds the module to the scope once."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to access a variable defined in a child scope from the parent scope?", "completion": "No, a variable defined in a child scope is not available for use within parent or ancestor scopes."}
{"prompt": "What is the role of the prescribed behavior of a statement in Blended?", "completion": "The prescribed behavior of a statement in Blended determines how a code segment is rendered. This behavior is defined by the statement to which the code segment belongs."}
{"prompt": "What will happen if a code segment is not employed in any statement within Blended?", "completion": "If a code segment is not used in any statement in Blended, it will not be rendered and will not have any effect on the output."}
{"prompt": "What are the items that make up the Render scope?", "completion": "It has data provided by application at time of 'render' invocation"}
{"prompt": "What are the delimiters utilized for named tags in Blended?", "completion": "The delimiters used in Blended for named tags are {% and %}."}
{"prompt": "What effect does this rule have on the dynamic calculation of the application scope for the master template?", "completion": "If the application scope is to be dynamically calculated for the master template, then the rule applies."}
{"prompt": "What are the implications of the rule for built-in function names in Blended?", "completion": "Built-in function names are defined within the outermost scope, the \u201cbuilt-in\u201d scope. No functions, variables, macros, or imported modules may share a name with any built-in functions. Built-in functions are defined as part of the language specification itself."}
{"prompt": "In the context of a for...else block, what will happen if the list being iterated over is devoid of elements?", "completion": "In Blended, if there are no items in the list being iterated over in a for...else block, the code inside the else section will be executed."}
{"prompt": "Can a macro be defined within a for...else statement?", "completion": "No, the macro statement may not appear inside a for...else statement."}
{"prompt": "Can a block within another block access variables from the outer block?", "completion": "No, nested blocks do not have access to any element of any other block scope, even the scope of a containing block."}
{"prompt": "Can functions defined in a block be called from outside the block?", "completion": "No, functions defined in a block are not accessible outside of that block. They are scoped to the block and are only available within the block's context."}
{"prompt": "Can macros within the same scope call other macros?", "completion": "Yes, macros can call other macros defined in the same scope."}
