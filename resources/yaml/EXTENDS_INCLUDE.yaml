"overview": |-
    Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is FALSE.
