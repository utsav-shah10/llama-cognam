Regular strings are not marked as safe and may contain potentially harmful content."}
{"prompt": "If I need to access an item within an array, how can I do it?", "completion": "You can access an element within an array by using its index. For example, if you have an array `myArray` and you want to access the first element, you can do so by using `{{myArray.0}}`."}
{"prompt": "What impact does the addition of a template containing only the 'IS USED' keyword have on the scope comparison?", "completion": "If the only keyword used in the include tag is 'IS USED', the included template's application scope expectation is only compared to whatever values are supplied using the include tag's 'with' argument, to determine if they are sufficient."}
{"prompt": "If a master template lacks a schema-definition or user-function-definition file, what consequences arise?", "completion": "The application scope expectation of the included template is accreted to the application scope of the master template."}
{"prompt": "What occurs when the argument is a number in the string filter?", "completion": "If the argument is a number in the string filter, it will convert the number to a string.

For example, if you are trying to access a property of an object that might not exist, using the 'or' operator could return a falsy value instead of the actual property value, leading to unexpected behavior."}
{"prompt": "Can the master template pass variables to the included template that are not defined in the included template?", "completion": "Yes, the master template can pass variables to the included template, but these variables must be defined in the included template's scope or be passed as arguments to the include tag."}
{"prompt": "If I aim to delve into a property that is nested within another property?", "completion": "You can access a property that is nested within another property by chaining the property names. For example, if you have an object `myObject` with a property `details` that is an object itself, you can access its property `age` by using `{{myObject.details.age}}`."}
{"prompt": "What occurs if a variable is defined inside a function and then utilized outside of that function?", "completion": "The variable is not available outside the function. It is local to the function and cannot be accessed outside of it."}

{"prompt": "What would happen if a function is declared in the user space but not employed in the template?", "completion": "In Blended, if a function is defined in the user environment but not used in the template, it will not be executed. This means that the function will not have any effect on the output of the template."}
{"prompt": "If the included template's scope expectations are not satisfied by the values passed to the master template, what will be the outcome?", "completion": "The included template will not be applied, and the master template will continue to execute as if the include tag were not present."}
{"prompt": "What are the delimiters for expression tags in the Blended platform?", "completion": "Expression tags use the \u201c{{\u201d and \u201c}}\u201d delimiters."}
{"prompt": "How does the concat function operate with arrays in the Blended platform?", "completion": "The concat function in Blended concatenates two arrays by appending all the elements of the second array to the end of the first array, resulting in a new array that contains all the elements from both input arrays."}
{"prompt": "What will occur if I use the escape filter on a string that has already been escaped?", "completion": "If a string is already escaped, applying the escape filter again will not change its content. The string will remain in its escaped form."}
{"prompt": "What is the distinction between the 'iterator' and 'loop' scopes in a Blended for...else statement?", "completion": "The 'iterator' scope persists for the duration of the tag's execution, while the 'loop' scope is a child scope encapsulated by the 'iterator' scope."}
{"prompt": "What steps should I take to ensure that all functions used in my Blended application are defined within the user's environment?", "completion": "To ensure that all functions used in your Blended application are defined in the user environment, you should define all functions in the user environment before using them in the templates. This can be done by creating a separate file for user-defined functions and importing them into your templates."}
{"prompt": "What is the behavior of the `length` function when applied to an empty collection?", "completion": "The `length` function returns 0 for empty collections, whether they are strings or lists."}
{"prompt": "Can the escape filter be applied to a list or array of strings?", "completion": "Yes, the escape filter can be applied to a list or array of strings. It will escape each string in the list individually."}
{"prompt": "What is the process of analysis when a template is integrated?", "completion": "With regards to any template inserted via the include tag: FIRST, an isolated semantic analysis is performed on the included template; then, SECOND, semantic analysis is performed on the master template, whereupon reaching the include tag it is determined whether or not the included template\u2019s application scope expectation is satisfied by the values being passed into that template by the master template."}
{"prompt": "Is it feasible to define a function in both the template and the user environment?", "completion": "Yes, a function can be defined in both the template and the user environment. However, the function defined in the user environment will take precedence over the one defined in the template. This means that if a function with the same name is defined in both places, the one in the user environment will be used."}

These tags are specifically designed to prevent the inclusion of Jinja/Twig syntax within verbatim statements, which could lead to syntax errors."}
{"prompt": "Can the else clause of a for...else block be utilized with other control structures such as if...else?", "completion": "Yes, the else section of a for...else block can be used with other control structures like if...else. However, the else section of a for...else block will only execute if the for loop is not executed due to a condition outside the loop."}
{"prompt": "Could I employ a built-in function name as a variable or macro name in Blended?", "completion": "No, you cannot use a built-in function name as a variable or macro name in Blended.
