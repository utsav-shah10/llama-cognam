{"prompt": "What is the difference between `loop.first` and `loop.last` in a for loop?", "completion": "The main difference is that `loop.first` indicates whether the current iteration is the first one, while `loop.last` indicates whether the current iteration is the last one."}
{"prompt": "What occurs if a macro defined within the same scope includes a macro from another scope?", "completion": "The macro from another scope is not accessible within the macro defined within the same scope."}
{"prompt": "What are the potential repercussions of disregarding the guideline for built-in function names in Blended?", "completion": "Not following the rule regarding built-in function names in Blended can lead to syntax errors, confusion, and potential security issues. It can also make it difficult to maintain and understand the codebase, as built-in functions are critical to the language's functionality."}
{"prompt": "Can I import a module that has a variable with the same name as a macro in the current scope?", "completion": "Yes, in Blended, a module can contain a variable with the same name as a macro in the current scope. The variable will not overwrite the macro."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to define a function in both the template and the user environment?", "completion": "Yes, a function can be defined in both the template and the user environment. However, the function defined in the user environment will take precedence over the one defined in the template. This means that if a function with the same name is defined in both places, the one in the user environment will be used."}
{"prompt": "What occurs if a variable is defined in the 'Loop' scope and then used outside of it?", "completion": "If a variable is defined within the 'Loop' scope and then used outside of it, it will not be accessible outside of the loop. Linter will throw an error."}
{"prompt": "Can this syntax be used for other collection types in Blended?", "completion": "No, this syntax is specifically for iterating over dictionaries. It does not work for lists, sets, or other types of collections. For other types of collections, you would need to use different syntax."}
{"prompt": "Is it feasible for the else part of a for...else statement to be left blank?", "completion": "Yes, the else section of a for...else block can be empty. If there are no items in the list, the else section will not execute any code."}
{"prompt": "What will the output of the ceil function be if the input is an integer?", "completion": "If the input to the ceil function is already an integer, the function will return the integer itself. For example, ceil(5) returns 5."}
{"prompt": "What is the scope of a user function?", "completion": "It includes all custom functions provided by user or application"}
{"prompt": "If a template is not accepted by Blended-Lint, what will happen?", "completion": "The template will not be compatible with Blended."}

{"prompt": "What is the format of the string argument for the `rgbcolor` function if it starts with a hash symbol?", "completion": "The string argument for the `rgbcolor` function must start with '#' followed by three hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f) for each color component (red, green, blue). For example, '#ff0000' represents red."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between `ifblock` and `if` in the Blended system?", "completion": "The `ifblock` in Blended is used to check for the existence of a block, while the `if` statement is used to check for a condition in the context of a block."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the 'else' block in a 'for...else' block in the Blended platform?", "completion": "The 'else' block in a 'for...else' block in Blended is used to execute code when the loop completes without finding any items to iterate over."}
{"prompt": "What measures does Blended-Lint take to ensure that a valid Blended template executes identically in various runtime contexts?", "completion": "Blended-Lint constructs rules to ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in exactly the same way regardless of what Blended-compatible runtime is used."}
{"prompt": "Is it feasible to use the keyword 'super' as a function name in Blended?", "completion": "No, 'super' is a reserved function name and cannot be used by user functions or macros."}
{"prompt": "What would happen if the for loop does not execute because of a condition outside the loop?", "completion": "In Blended, if the for loop is not executed due to a condition outside the loop, the else section will not execute any code."}
{"prompt": "Determine 5 essential functions included in Blended", "completion": "Here are the five built in functions in Blended : lower, upper, length, mean, rgbcolor etc."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible for a double quote to contain a single quote?", "completion": "Yes, a double quote can contain a single quote."}
{"prompt": "If a macro in Blended shares the same name as a function defined in the same scope, what would happen?", "completion": "The macro will not be defined, and we will get an error from the compiler"}
{"prompt": "Is it feasible to name a variable 'truncate'? ", "completion": "No, you cannot name a variable 'truncate' because 'truncate' is a built-in function and so it cannot share a name with a variable or anything else. "}
{"prompt": "What will happen if a code segment is not employed in any statement within Blended?", "completion": "If a code segment is not used in any statement in Blended, it will not be rendered and will not have any effect on the output."}
{"prompt": "Can I incorporate built-in functions from other modules into Blended?", "completion": "No, you cannot import built-in functions from other modules in Blended. Built-in functions are part of the language specification and are not meant to be imported from external modules."}
{"prompt": "What will happen if I try to alter a loop variable within a for loop in Blended?", "completion": "In Blended, attempting to modify a loop variable inside a for loop will result in a syntax error or runtime error, as the rule explicitly prohibits such modifications."}
{"prompt": "Can the `notIn` operator be used for numeric values?", "completion": "No, the `notIn` operator works only on strings and arrays."}
{"prompt": "Can a variable be redefined in a child scope?", "completion": "No, it cannot be redefined. In Blended, multiple declarations of a variable are not allowed. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error."}
{"prompt": "Is it feasible to include a template with the `include` tag in Blended?", "completion": "Yes, you can include a template using the `include` tag in Blended."}
{"prompt": "How do custom functions differ from standard functions in Blended?", "completion": "Custom functions are functions that are defined and implemented by the application, while built-in functions are functions that are part of the language's core functionality."}
{"prompt": "How does the imported template file collaborate with the current namespace?", "completion": "The imported template file is evaluated without having any reference to the current namespace that contains the tag."}
{"prompt": "What is the fundamental objective of statements in Blended?", "completion": "Statements in Blended are the control structures that operate on the context and its data, contributing to the final rendered output of a template."}
{"prompt": "Is it feasible to have a double quote within a single quote?", "completion": "Yes, a single quote can contain a double quote."}
{"prompt": "How does the lower function operate?", "completion": "The lower function takes a string as an argument and returns the string in lowercase."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible for a macro to access variables that are not defined in the caller's scope?", "completion": "No, a macro can only access variables that are explicitly passed as arguments."}
{"prompt": "If the included template's scope expectation is not met by the values provided to the master template, what will happen?", "completion": "The included template will not be applied, and the master template will continue to execute as if the include tag were not present."}
{"prompt": "Can a macro in Blended have the same name as a class defined in the same scope?", "completion": "The macro will not be defined, and we will get an error from the compiler"}
{"prompt": "Is it possible for a macro in Blended to share the name of a macro defined in a parent scope?", "completion": "The macro will not be defined, and we will get an error from the compiler"}
{"prompt": "What are the distinctions between block scope in root templates and child templates within Blended?", "completion": "In root templates, instances of the block scope are always evaluated as children of the template scope that contains it. In child templates, block scope instances are evaluated as children of the block scope of the template that extends it."}
{"prompt": "How can I apply the int filter in a Blended template?", "completion": "To use the int filter in a Blended template, you apply it to a string that represents an integer. For example, '10' | int will convert the string '10' to the integer 10."}
{"prompt": "Is it feasible to use the safe filter on a regular string to make it secure?", "completion": "Yes, you can use the safe filter on a regular string to make it safe. This is useful when you want to ensure that a string containing potentially harmful content is treated as safe for output."}
{"prompt": "Can I add a template with block tags or extends tags to Blended?", "completion": "No, you cannot include a template that contains block tags or an extends tag in Blended."}
{"prompt": "What will occur if I try to create a function with the same name as a built-in function in Blended?", "completion": "Attempting to define a function with the same name as a built-in function in Blended will result in a syntax error. The language specification explicitly prohibits this to maintain clarity and prevent conflicts with built-in functionality."}
{"prompt": "What will occur if a variable is defined in a parent scope and a child scope tries to redefine it?", "completion": "The child scope will not be able to redefine the variable as multiple declarations are not allowed in Blended."}
{"prompt": "What steps should I take to ensure the 'Iterator' scope is correctly applied in my Blended code?", "completion": "To ensure that the 'Iterator' scope is used correctly in your Blended code, you should follow the rule that the 'Iterator' scope is specifically designed to be used within the 'for...else' block. This ensures that the iterator is properly managed and does not interfere with other parts of the code."}
{"prompt": "Can the `rgbcolor` function process RGB values that exceed the range of 0 to 255?", "completion": "No, the `rgbcolor` function only accepts RGB values within the range of 0 to 255."}
{"prompt": "Can I reference a variable defined in the parent scope from within a child scope?", "completion": "Yes, you can use variables declared in the parent scope within a child scope."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference in the scope of a macro and a block tag?", "completion": "The scope of a macro is the root template, while the scope of a block tag is the block itself."}
{"prompt": "What is the range of the 'built-in' scope in Blended?", "completion": "The 'built-in' scope includes all the built-in variables and functions available in Jinja/Twig."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to concatenate strings using the `+` operator in Blended?", "completion": "No, the `+` operator is not allowed in Blended. Instead, you should use the `~` operator for string concatenation."}
{"prompt": "How do comments influence the code's functionality in Blended?", "completion": "Comments do not affect the execution of the code in Blended. They are purely for documentation and readability."}
{"prompt": "How does the rule manage the incorporation of variables and functions within tags or expressions?", "completion": "Variables and functions defined within a tag or expression are only accessible within that tag or expression. They are not accessible outside of the tag or expression unless explicitly passed as arguments."}
{"prompt": "Can strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries be incorporated as literal values passed as input to a tag?", "completion": "Yes, strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries can be added to the scope as literal values passed in as input to a tag."}
