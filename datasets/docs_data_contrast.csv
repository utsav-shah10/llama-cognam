"Correct syntax for dual item iteration is for a,b (dict) | items",Can I iterate over a dictionary in Blended if it's nested?,"Yes, you can iterate over a dictionary in Blended if it's nested. For example, if you have a dictionary with another dictionary as a value, you can iterate over it using the same syntax.

Functions must be present in user environment to be used,Can a function be defined in both the template and the user environment?,"Yes, a function can be defined in both the template and the user environment. However, the function defined in the user environment will take precedence over the one defined in the template. This means that if a function with the same name is defined in both places, the one in the user environment will be used."
Functions must be present in user environment to be used,What happens if a function is defined in the user environment but not used in the template?,"In Blended, if a function is defined in the user environment but not used in the template, it will not be executed. This means that the function will not have any effect on the output of the template."
Functions must be present in user environment to be used,How can I ensure that all functions used in my Blended application are defined in the user environment?,"To ensure that all functions used in your Blended application are defined in the user environment, you should define all functions in the user environment before using them in the templates. This can be done by creating a separate file for user-defined functions and importing them into your templates."

"Direct usage {{x.b}} is not allowed if x doesn't contain b as key, where x is an object.",What happens if I try to access a property that doesn't exist in an object?,"In Blended, attempting to access a property that doesn't exist in an object will result in an error. For example, if you try to access `{{x.c}}` where `x` is an object that doesn't have a key `c`, the code will fail."
"Direct usage {{x.b}} is not allowed if x doesn't contain b as key, where x is an object.",Why can't I directly use '{{x.b}}'?,"It may be possible that object 'x' doesn't has the key 'b'. So, it is always better to keep a check."
"Direct usage {{x.b}} is not allowed if x doesn't contain b as key, where x is an object.",Can I use a variable to store an object and then access its properties?,"Yes, you can use a variable to store an object and then access its properties.

"Direct usage {{x.b}} is not allowed if x doesn't contain b as key, where x is an object.",What if I want to access a property that is nested within another property?,"You can access a property that is nested within another property by chaining the property names. For example, if you have an object `myObject` with a property `details` that is an object itself, you can access its property `age` by using `{{myObject.details.age}}`."
"Direct usage {{x.b}} is not allowed if x doesn't contain b as key, where x is an object.",What if I want to access a property that is an array and I want to access an element within it?,"You can access an element within an array by using its index. For example, if you have an array `myArray` and you want to access the first element, you can do so by using `{{myArray.0}}`."
"Direct usage {{x.b}} is not allowed if x doesn't contain b as key, where x is an object.",What if I want to access a property that is a function and I want to call it?,"You can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses. For example, if you have a function `myFunction` and you want to call it, you can do so by using `{{myFunction()}}`."
x.b can be used only with 'and' operator in if conditions,Why x.b is allowed to be used with 'and' operator only?,"x.b is allowed to be used with 'and' operator only because, it ensures that the property 'b' of object 'x' exists before usage. "
x.b can be used only with 'and' operator in if conditions,Can I use x.b with 'or' operator?,"No, you cannot use it with 'or' operator because it might be possible that x.b doesn't exist but still used further which will result in error. "
or' operator is not valid with potentially undefined object properties,What happens if I use the 'or' operator with a potentially undefined object property in Blended?,"In Blended, using the 'or' operator with a potentially undefined object property will result in a runtime error. This is because the 'or' operator in Blended is not designed to handle undefined values in the same way as it does in Jinja/Twig. Instead, it will evaluate the left operand and if it is truthy, it will return the left operand; otherwise, it will return the right operand. If the left operand is undefined, it will return the right operand, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."
or' operator is not valid with potentially undefined object properties,What are some common scenarios where using the 'or' operator with potentially undefined object properties could lead to errors?,"Using the 'or' operator with potentially undefined object properties could lead to errors in scenarios where the left operand is undefined and the right operand is not a valid value for the context. For example, if you are trying to access a property of an object that might not exist, using the 'or' operator could return a falsy value instead of the actual property value, leading to unexpected behavior."
or' operator is not valid with potentially undefined object properties,What are some best practices for using the 'or' operator in Blended with potentially undefined object properties?,"When using the 'or' operator in Blended with potentially undefined object properties, it is important to ensure that the right operand is a valid value for the context. You should also consider using the ternary operator or the nullish coalescing operator to handle undefined values safely."

Items present in context cannot be modified,How can I access items in the context?,"You can access items in the context using the same syntax as in Jinja/Twig, but you cannot modify them."
Items present in context cannot be modified,Can I modify the item present in context?,"No, Items present in context cannot be modified"
Items present in context cannot be modified,What if I want to modify a specific item in the context?,"You cannot modify a specific item in the context. Instead, you can create a new item with the same name or use a different name to avoid conflicts."
Items present in context cannot be modified,Can I use loops or conditions to modify items in the context?,"No, you cannot use loops or conditions to modify items in the context. These constructs are used to iterate over or conditionally process items, but they do not allow modification."
Items not present in context cannot be used directly,What happens if I try to use a variable that is not defined in the current context?,"In Blended, attempting to use a variable that is not present in the current context will result in a syntax error. This is because the rule strictly enforces that only items present in the context can be used directly."
Items not present in context cannot be used directly,What if I want to use a variable from a sibling context in Blended?,"In Blended, to use a variable from a sibling context, you must explicitly pass it down as an argument to the current context.
