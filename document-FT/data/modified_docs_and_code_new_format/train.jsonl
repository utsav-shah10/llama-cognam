For example, if you have a variable `name` set to 'Alice', then {{ 'Hello, ' ~ name }} will result in 'Hello, Alice'."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The import tag adds a module to the current scope. The macros declared inside the imported file, and only those macros, are added as members of the module, accessible through dot notation. Because the imported template is independently evaluated by Blended-Lint prior to importation, it is ensured that all macros accessible via the module will be without conflict amongst themselves. All other contents of the imported template (including any variables set or macros or modules imported) are ignored and discarded upon import. Variable data (i.e. non-macro data) is not imported.\nWhat happens if a macro from an imported file has the same name as a macro in the current scope?", "completion": "In Blended, if a macro in the imported file has the same name as a macro in the current scope, the macro in the imported file will overwrite the macro in the current scope."}

It is local to the loop and cannot be accessed outside of it."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: No data names used in any parent or ancestor scope may be modified or overridden within any child or descendant scope--they are read-only within the child or descendant scope. This means that names in use by the parent scope (or in any ancestor scope) may not be used as a target for set, as a macro name, as a name for a module imported using the import tag, or as an iteration item in the for tag. Only names declared within the current scope may be overwritten.\nWhich data names can be modified?", "completion": "Data names declared in current scope can be overridden and not any other."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: In Jinja, values that are updated inside the for loop carry forward from iteration to iteration, but fall out of scope when the loop terminates. In Twig, values set inside the loop do not fall out of scope and persist after the for loop ends. Blended solves this problem by specifying specific scoping rules and enforcing them through the Blended-Lint program. These rules are constructed to ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in exactly the same way regardless of what Blended-compatible runtime is used, and to ensure that any template code that executes differently in the various Blended-compliant runtimes is rejected by Blended-Lint.\nWhat strategies does Blended-Lint employ to ensure that a valid Blended template runs identically in different runtime environments?", "completion": "Blended-Lint constructs rules to ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in exactly the same way regardless of what Blended-compatible runtime is used."}

In Twig, values set inside the loop do not fall out of scope and persist after the for loop ends. Blended solves this problem by specifying specific scoping rules and enforcing them through the Blended-Lint program. These rules are constructed to ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in exactly the same way regardless of what Blended-compatible runtime is used, and to ensure that any template code that executes differently in the various Blended-compliant runtimes is rejected by Blended-Lint.\nWhat is the fate of variables set within a for loop in Twig?", "completion": "In Twig, variables set inside a for loop persist after the loop ends, unlike in Jinja where they fall out of scope when the loop terminates."}

If the only keyword IS USED in the include tag, then the included template\u2019s application scope expectation is only compared to whatever values are supplied using the include tag\u2019s with argument, to determine if they are sufficient. However, if the only keyword IS NOT USED in the include tag, the contents of the current scope, plus whatever values are supplied using the include tag\u2019s with argument, are compared to the included template\u2019s application scope expectation.\nHow does the addition of a template with a 'with' argument influence the scope comparison?", "completion": "The inclusion of a template with a 'with' argument allows the user to provide specific values for the template's scope, which are then compared to the template's application scope expectation."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Macros are different: the only external objects automatically accessible from inside a macro are built-in functions, user functions, and whatever other macros were defined inside the same scope.\nCan macros in programming environments access variables that are defined outside their defined scope?", "completion": "No, macros can only access variables defined inside their scope or those explicitly passed as arguments."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: No data names used in any parent or ancestor scope may be modified or overridden within any child or descendant scope--they are read-only within the child or descendant scope. This means that names in use by the parent scope (or in any ancestor scope) may not be used as a target for set, as a macro name, as a name for a module imported using the import tag, or as an iteration item in the for tag. Only names declared within the current scope may be overwritten.\nCan I define a target for the variable that was declared in the parent context?", "completion": "No, you cannot set a target for a variable declared in parent scope as they are read only and cannot be modified."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Application' scope is the child of the 'user-function' scope, and is the parent of the template scope. As a result, it follows naturally that it is both immutable, and global within the template. Variables defined in the application scope are accessible inside all templates and tags, but no such variable may be modified or overwritten in any template by any tag.\nWhat are the consequences of the 'Application' scope being unchangeable and universal?", "completion": "Variables defined in the 'Application' scope are accessible inside all templates and tags, but no such variable may be modified or overwritten in any template by any tag."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Macros can make recursive calls to themselves, but circular calls between and among macros is prohibited.\nWhat are the potential outcomes if a macro's self-calling mechanism results in an endless loop?", "completion": "Circular calls between macros are strictly prohibited, and attempting to do so will result in a compilation error."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Reserved words cannot be used as variables. Reserved words include: true, TRUE, block, ifblock, if, else, elif, set, print, block etc. loop can be used as variable only inside loop scope\nWhich words are reserved in the blended system?", "completion": "Reserved words are generally filters, builtin functions in blended which cannot be overridden. For example, print, TRUE, true, set, if, ifblock etc"}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Nested blocks are treated in much the same way that parent blocks are. They are evaluated as direct children of the template scope at the position of the outer-most containing block. Then, the contents, as-evaluated, are inserted into the template at the position of the block block declaration. Nested blocks are not evaluated at the position of their containing block, and do not have access to any element of any other block scope, even the scope of a containing block.\nIs it possible for a block to access variables from its parent block?", "completion": "No, nested blocks do not have access to any element of any other block scope, even the scope of a containing block."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: In Jinja, length is a filter. In Blended, this filter has been converted into a built-in function named length, which takes an array or string as an argument and returns the length of the provided object.\nIn the event that the input to the length function is not an array or a string, what will be the outcome?", "completion": "The length function will raise an error because it is designed to work only with arrays or strings."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Loop variables cannot be modified inside the for loop.\nIs it possible to utilize a loop variable to hold a value that serves as the loop's control mechanism?", "completion": "No, you cannot use a loop variable to store a value that is used to control the loop's iteration. This would violate the rule and lead to a syntax error or runtime error."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: When any template file is imported--whether it is imported using the from...import tag or the import tag--that file is evaluated without having any reference to the current namespace that contains the tag. The imported file shares the 'built-in' scope and the 'user-function' scope of the master template, but it is provided with an empty 'application' scope before it is evaluated.\nWhat are the main differences between the 'built-in' scope and the 'user-function' scope in the imported template file?", "completion": "The 'built-in' scope includes predefined functions and variables that are available to all templates, while the 'user-function' scope includes functions and variables that are defined in the master template."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: In Jinja, upper is a filter. In Blended, this filter has been converted into a built-in function named upper, which takes a string as input and returns its uppercase form.\nDoes the Jinja function have an upper function in the Blended system?", "completion": "No, upper function of Jinja is converted to built-in function of Blended."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The for...else statement\u2019s 'else' scope (which is coincident with the contents of the template segment that follows the else tag, termed the 'else segment') is a sibling of the 'iterator' scope, and therefore only shares with it and the 'loop' scope whatever variables are defined in the scope that contains the for...else statement itself. It does not have access to the forloop variable nor the named item variables from the 'iterator' scope.\nCould the 'else' block access named variables defined in the 'iterator' context?", "completion": "No, the 'else' segment does not have access to named item variables from the 'iterator' scope."}

In Blended, this filter has been converted into a built-in function named rgbcolor which takes an array of size 3 or a string starting with \u2018#\u2019 as an argument and returns the color of the provided RGB values.\nCould the `rgbcolor` function handle RGB values that are outside the typical 0 to 255 range?", "completion": "No, the `rgbcolor` function only accepts RGB values within the range of 0 to 255."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Data is typically referenced and accessed by name. All data names occupy the same namespace. Any rules regarding names in general apply equally to variable names, function names, macro names and module names (i.e. to all data types). At any point in a file, the current namespace consists of the current scope (read-write), and all parent and ancestor scopes (read-only).\nAre all data names contained within the same namespace?", "completion": "Yes, all data names occupy same namespace"}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Concatenate (~) operator works on strings. {{ 'hello' ~ 'world' }} is valid.\nWhat's the process for concatenating a string with a variable in Blended?", "completion": "You can concatenate a string with a variable using the Concatenate (~) operator.

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Functions must be present in user environment to be used\nWhat would happen if a function is created in the user space but not implemented in the template?", "completion": "In Blended, if a function is defined in the user environment but not used in the template, it will not be executed. This means that the function will not have any effect on the output of the template."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: How to use render statement : {{ 'hello' }}, {{ var }}, {{ 10 }}.\nWhat are the steps to employ the render statement?", "completion": "Render statement can be used using expression tags - '{{ }}'.

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The 'block', 'super', '_', 'on', 'off' and 'forloop' variable names are treated as reserved keywords that may not be used as variable names, nor accessed within expressions (with the exception of the 'forloop' dictionary being referenced inside the 'loop' scope). Certain function names are also reserved. Specifically, 'super' and '_' are reserved as function names and may not be used by user functions or macros. 'True', 'true', 'False' and 'false' are similarly reserved.\nCould I employ the keyword 'off' as a variable name within Blended?", "completion": "No, 'off' is a reserved keyword and cannot be used as a variable name."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: In Jinja, values that are updated inside the for loop carry forward from iteration to iteration, but fall out of scope when the loop terminates. In Twig, values set inside the loop do not fall out of scope and persist after the for loop ends. Blended solves this problem by specifying specific scoping rules and enforcing them through the Blended-Lint program. These rules are constructed to ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in exactly the same way regardless of what Blended-compatible runtime is used, and to ensure that any template code that executes differently in the various Blended-compliant runtimes is rejected by Blended-Lint.\nWhat happens to variables declared inside a for loop in Twig?", "completion": "In Twig, variables set inside a for loop persist after the loop ends, unlike in Jinja where they fall out of scope when the loop terminates."}

The for...else statement\u2019s 'loop' scope is a child scope encapsulated by the 'iterator' scope. By this arrangement, the forloop variable and the named item variable(s) are prohibited from being modified inside the 'loop' scope.\nWhat are the differences between the 'iterator' and 'loop' scopes in a Blended for...else loop?", "completion": "The 'iterator' scope persists for the duration of the tag's execution, while the 'loop' scope is a child scope encapsulated by the 'iterator' scope."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The include tag makes no modification to any scope of the master template; it neither adds nor modifies any object.

In Twig, values set inside the loop do not fall out of scope and persist after the for loop ends. Blended solves this problem by specifying specific scoping rules and enforcing them through the Blended-Lint program. These rules are constructed to ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in exactly the same way regardless of what Blended-compatible runtime is used, and to ensure that any template code that executes differently in the various Blended-compliant runtimes is rejected by Blended-Lint.\nIn Jinja, values updated within the for loop are retained across iterations but vanish upon the loop's termination.

{"prompt": "[code-task] Establish a block labeled 'styles' and display the variable 'custom_css'", "completion": "{% block styles %}{% print custom_css %}{% endblock %}"}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: notIn operator works on string and array. It checks if an item is not present in a string or array.\nIs the `notIn` operator applicable to arrays?", "completion": "Yes, the `notIn` operator checks if an item is not present in an array."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Items present in context cannot be modified\nHow can I modify a specific item within the context?", "completion": "You cannot modify a specific item in the context. Instead, you can create a new item with the same name or use a different name to avoid conflicts."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries (i.e. basic variable types) are added to a scope as literal values passed in as input to a tag, or by being part of the application-provided context. They can also be added to a scope as a transformation performed on other variable data via filters, or as the return values of functions, which may then be passed in as input to a tag.\nCould strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries be incorporated into the scope as literal values provided as input to a tag?", "completion": "Yes, strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries can be added to the scope as literal values passed in as input to a tag."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: x.b can be used only with 'and' operator in if conditions\nCould I employ x.b in conjunction with the 'or' operator?", "completion": "No, you cannot use it with 'or' operator because it might be possible that x.b doesn't exist but still used further which will result in error."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The for...else statement effectively has three distinct scoping levels: the 'iterator' scope, the 'loop' scope, and the 'else' scope. The for...else statement\u2019s 'iterator' scope persists for the duration of the tag\u2019s execution, and contains the named item variables and the forloop variable. The for...else statement\u2019s 'loop' scope is a child scope encapsulated by the 'iterator' scope. By this arrangement, the forloop variable and the named item variable(s) are prohibited from being modified inside the 'loop' scope.\nIn a Blended for...else statement, how do the 'iterator' and 'loop' scopes differ?", "completion": "The 'iterator' scope persists for the duration of the tag's execution, while the 'loop' scope is a child scope encapsulated by the 'iterator' scope."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: When any template file is imported--whether it is imported using the from...import tag or the import tag--that file is evaluated without having any reference to the current namespace that contains the tag. The imported file shares the 'built-in' scope and the 'user-function' scope of the master template, but it is provided with an empty 'application' scope before it is evaluated.\nWhat is the relationship between the imported template file and the current namespace?", "completion": "The imported template file is evaluated without having any reference to the current namespace that contains the tag."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: For someone whose only objective is to write Blended-compatible templates for their website, knowing the below four points should be sufficient. Inside a macro, you can also import macros from other files, but the only way that a macro can get access to outside variables is for them to be passed in as arguments. Names defined inside parent or ancestor scopes are available for use within child or descendant scopes, but not vice-versa; Names defined inside parent or ancestor scopes cannot be overwritten or modified within child or descendant scopes--they are read-only; Names defined inside a scope are unavailable after the scope exits--they are local to that scope; Macros are different: the only external objects automatically accessible from inside a macro are built-in functions, user functions, and whatever other macros were defined inside the same scope.\nCan names defined in parent or ancestor scopes be updated or modified within child or descendant scopes?", "completion": "No, names defined inside parent or ancestor scopes cannot be overwritten or modified within child or descendant scopes."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: How to use upper function in Blended : upper('hello')\nIn the context of a Blended template, how can I apply the `upper` function to a variable?", "completion": "You can apply the `upper` function to a variable by referencing it within the function call, like `upper(my_variable)`, where `my_variable` is a string."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Block' scope: template code inside block tags\nIs the variable 'var' defined outside of any block, and does it have a block-level scope?", "completion": "No, block scope only contains the template code inside block tags."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Timestamps may be introduced by applying the datetime filter to properly formatted lists or to properly formatted strings.\nWhat is the proper format for a datetime filter string?", "completion": "A properly formatted string for the datetime filter should be in a format that can be parsed into a timestamp, such as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or '2023-10-05 14:30:00'."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The include tag makes no modification to any scope of the master template; it neither adds nor modifies any object. The include tag simply renders the referenced template in place.\nWhat if I add a template that contains a function to modify a variable in the master template?", "completion": "The included template will not modify the variable in the master template. The function will only affect the scope of the included template."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Correct syntax for dual item iteration is for a,b (dict) | items\nIn Blended, how can I retrieve both the key and value from a dictionary during iteration?", "completion": "In Blended, you can access the key and value in a dictionary during iteration using the syntax `for a, b in (dict) | items`. Here's an example: `for key, value in my_dict | items: print(f'Key: {key}, Value: {value}')`."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: In Jinja, floor is a filter. In Blended, this filter has been converted into a built-in function named floor, which takes a number as an argument and returns the floor of the provided number.\nIs it possible to integrate the floor function with other mathematical functions?", "completion": "Yes, the floor function can be used in combination with other functions. For example, `{{ 3.7 | floor | add(1) }}` will return `4`."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: With regards to any template inserted via the include tag: FIRST, an isolated semantic analysis is performed on the included template; then, SECOND, semantic analysis is performed on the master template, whereupon reaching the include tag it is determined whether or not the included template\u2019s application scope expectation is satisfied by the values being passed into that template by the master template.\nWhat happens when the template is not found or cannot be loaded?", "completion": "The master template will not apply the included template, and the error will be reported, preventing the master template from continuing to execute."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The from...import tag adds macro names to the current scope. Unlike the macro tag declaration, the macros added using from...import are not accessible from inside macros that are defined within the same scope. As mentioned above, if an import is required, a macro will need to contain the import instruction inside the 'macro' scope itself.\nWhat would happen if a macro were to import a macro that is defined within the same scope but not imported by any other macro in the same scope?", "completion": "The macro from the same scope is not accessible within the macro that imports it."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: in operator works on string and array. It checks if an item is present in a string or array.\nIn what way does the 'in' operator function within Blended?", "completion": "The 'in' operator in Blended checks if an item is present in a string or array."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: In Jinja, lower, upper, length, mean, rgbcolor, title, truncate, ceil, floor, join, and concat are filters. In Blended, all these filters have been converted into built-in functions. Each of them is now called as a function (e.g., lower('HELLO')) and not used as filters.\nIs it possible to utilize 'lower' as a filter in Blended?", "completion": "No, 'lower' is a filter in Jinja and a function in Blended. So cannot be used as filter in Blended."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Loop variables cannot be modified inside the for loop.\nIn the event that I require a loop variable to store a value that is utilized to keep track of intermediate results?", "completion": "Yes, you can use a loop variable to store a value that is used to store intermediate results. For example, in a loop that calculates the factorial of a number, you can use a variable like `factorial` to store the intermediate results."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The 'template' scope is the scope of all variables, macros and modules defined inside the root template, outside of all macro tags, block tags, and for...else statements.\nHow do the scopes of macros and block tags differ?", "completion": "The scope of a macro is the root template, while the scope of a block tag is the block itself."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Names defined inside parent or ancestor scopes cannot be overwritten or modified within child or descendant scopes--they are read-only.\nHow does a variable in a child scope interact with a variable defined in a parent scope?", "completion": "They are read-only variables and thus, cannot be modified or redefined."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Twelve (12) data types exist in Blended templates: strings, numbers, booleans, lists (array type), dictionaries (object type), functions, macros, modules, templates, pair lists, timestamps (datetime type), safe strings, and escaped strings.\nWhat are the differences between safe strings and escaped strings in the Blended template system?", "completion": "Safe strings in Blended templates are those that are automatically escaped to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. Escaped strings, on the other hand, are those that are explicitly marked as safe and are not automatically escaped."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Single quotes can contain double quotes. Single quotes cannot contain another single quote. Double quotes can contain single quotes. Double quotes cannot contain another double quote\nIs it possible for a double quote to include a single quote?", "completion": "Yes, a double quote can contain a single quote."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Block' scope: template code inside block tags\nIf a variable is declared in multiple scopes, what are the potential consequences?", "completion": "Since all blocks have their independent scope, this variable will be unique in each block."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Any variable name that is referenced or accessed within the body of a template, but which has not been declared within the body of the template, should be assumed to have been introduced within the application scope. However, a JSON schema document may be provided to Blended-Lint which declares all of the application variables for a given template file. In the case that such a schema file is provided, any variable name that is referenced or accessed within the body of a template which has neither been declared within the body of the template nor declared within the JSON schema document shall be deemed an error ('variable undefined'), causing the file to be declared invalid.\nI have not declared a variable in the template's body, and I am trying to access it. Will I get an error?", "completion": "No, it is assumed that it is present in application scope. If not present there too, we get an error."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: The for...else statement\u2019s 'else' scope (which is coincident with the contents of the template segment that follows the else tag, termed the 'else segment') is a sibling of the 'iterator' scope, and therefore only shares with it and the 'loop' scope whatever variables are defined in the scope that contains the for...else statement itself. It does not have access to the forloop variable nor the named item variables from the 'iterator' scope.\nCan the 'else' part of the code access variables defined within the 'iterator' environment?", "completion": "No, the 'else' segment does not have access to named item variables from the 'iterator' scope."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: An included template shares the 'built-in' scope and the 'user-function' scope of the template from which it has been referenced (i.e. the master template). The 'application' scope of the included template varies depending on whether or not the only keyword is present inside the include tag. If the only keyword is present, then the 'application' scope of the included template is populated only by the dictionary passed in using the with keyword (if present). If the only keyword is missing, then the 'application' scope for the included template is populated by the master template\u2019s entire namespace at the point of the include template\u2019s evaluation, optionally updated and overwritten by the contents of the dictionary passed into the import tag using the with keyword. Below the level of the 'application' scope (starting with the 'template' scope), each imported template is to be analyzed as per the rules described herein, as if it were a standalone template.\nWhat encompasses the 'built-in' scope within the Blended framework?", "completion": "The 'built-in' scope includes all the built-in variables and functions available in Jinja/Twig."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Block' scope: template code inside block tags\nIs it possible to access variables defined within a block from outside that block?", "completion": "No, variables defined in a block are not accessible outside of that block. They are scoped to the block and are only available within the block's context."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: No data names used in any parent or ancestor scope may be modified or overridden within any child or descendant scope--they are read-only within the child or descendant scope. This means that names in use by the parent scope (or in any ancestor scope) may not be used as a target for set, as a macro name, as a name for a module imported using the import tag, or as an iteration item in the for tag. Only names declared within the current scope may be overwritten.\nCan I declare a macro with the same name as a variable declared in the enclosing scope?", "completion": "No, you cannot declare a macro with same name as a variable declared in parent scope and hence, it will throw an error."}

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: User-defined functions inhabit the second-level scope, the 'user-function' scope, which is the child of the 'built-in' scope. As follows from the rules above, no user-defined function may share the name of any built-in function, nor may any template-defined macro, variable or imported module share the name of any user-defined function. For purposes of Blended-Lint, user-defined functions are declared in a specifically-formatted JSON file that specifies each function\u2019s name, argument data types, and possible return types.\nIs it possible for a user-defined function to share the same name as a template-defined macro, variable, or imported module in Blended?", "completion": "No, a user-defined function cannot have the same name as a template-defined macro, variable, or imported module in Blended."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: User-function' scope: custom functions provided by the application\nIn what ways can custom functions be utilized in Blended?", "completion": "Custom functions in Blended are functions that are provided by the application and are not built into the language itself."}

The include tag simply renders the referenced template in place.\nCan I include a template that includes a loop to change a variable in the master template?", "completion": "The included template will not modify the variable in the master template. The loop will only affect the scope of the included template."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: or' operator is not valid with potentially undefined object properties\nWhat are the best practices for employing the 'or' operator when dealing with potentially undefined object properties?", "completion": "When using the 'or' operator in Blended with potentially undefined object properties, it is important to ensure that the right operand is a valid value for the context. You should also consider using the ternary operator or the nullish coalescing operator to handle undefined values safely."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: int filter: works on string, takes only one argument, does not work on boolean.\nIs it possible to apply the `int filter` to a boolean variable?", "completion": "No, the `int filter` does not work on boolean values.

{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: No macro may share the name of any other object defined before or after its definition in the same scope, or in any parent scope.\nCould I declare a variable with a name that's similar to a macro's name?", "completion": "No, macro cannot share name of any other object. It will throw an error."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Else' scope: template code inside the else section of a for...else block\nWhat would occur if the for loop runs without executing the else clause?", "completion": "In Blended, if the for loop is executed but the else section is not executed, it means that the for loop iterated over all items in the list and the else section was not triggered."}

Verbatim statement's code segment must not contain {% endverbatim %}\nIf I mistakenly use `{% endraw %}` or `{% endverbatim %}` outside of a verbatim block in Blended, what will happen?", "completion": "Using `{% endraw %}` or `{% endverbatim %}` outside of a verbatim statement will result in a syntax error. These tags are only valid within the context of a verbatim statement to prevent the parsing of the enclosed code as Jinja/Twig syntax."}
{"prompt": "[code-task] Transform the variable 'service_name' into title case, then update 'display_name' to the result concatenated with ' Service', and finally print it.", "completion": "{% set display_name = title(service_name) ~ ' Service' %} {% print display_name %}"}

In Blended, functions are provided by the environment and cannot be overridden."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Macro' scope: template code inside macro tags\nWhat is the extent of a macro's functionality in the Blended platform?", "completion": "In Blended, the scope of a macro is limited to the template code that is enclosed within the macro tags."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Macros can make recursive calls to themselves, but circular calls between and among macros is prohibited.\nWhat is the difference between a circular call and a recursive call in programming?", "completion": "Recursive call means that macro calling itself, while circular call mean macro A calling macro B and macro B calling macro A. It is a circular loop and hence not allowed."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: Comments are same as Jinja comments - {# \u2026 #}\nWhat role do comments play in the execution of code in Blended?", "completion": "Comments do not affect the execution of the code in Blended. They are purely for documentation and readability."}

However, if the only keyword IS NOT USED in the include tag, the contents of the current scope, plus whatever values are supplied using the include tag\u2019s with argument, are compared to the included template\u2019s application scope expectation.\nIn the absence of a schema-definition or user-function-definition file in a template, what are the potential outcomes?", "completion": "If a template does not have a schema-definition or user-function-definition file, its application scope expectation is defined as all of the 'application' and 'user-function' scoped values consumed and required by that template in its execution."}
{"prompt": "[doc-qna] Rule: When Blended code is parsed and compiled, the resultant template instance retains the ordered relationship of the static text to any statements contained within that text. If any named statement tag is immediately followed by a newline character, that character is removed from the template (with the exception of endverbatim tags).\nHow does the rule influence the arrangement of static text and statements in a Blended template?", "completion": "The resultant template instance retains the ordered relationship of the static text to any statements contained within that text."}

This is because the 'or' operator in Blended is not designed to handle undefined values in the same way as it does in Jinja/Twig. Instead, it will evaluate the left operand and if it is truthy, it will return the left operand; otherwise, it will return the right operand. If the left operand is undefined, it will return the right operand, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors."}
