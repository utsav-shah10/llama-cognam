This ensures that the iterator is properly managed and does not interfere with other parts of the code."}

{"prompt": "Is it permissible to use the keyword 'forloop' as a variable name in Blended?", "completion": "Yes, 'forloop' is a reserved keyword and can be used as a variable name, but it is only accessible within the scope of the 'loop' block."}
{"prompt": "What is the range of the 'Loop' in Blended?", "completion": "The 'Loop' scope in Blended refers to the template code that appears inside the `for` section of a `for...else` block."}

{"prompt": "What occurs when a nested block is included within a parent block?", "completion": "The nested block is evaluated as a direct child of the template scope at the position of the outer-most containing block. Then, the contents, as-evaluated, are inserted into the template at the position of the block block declaration. Nested blocks are not evaluated at the position of their containing block, and do not have access to any element of any other block scope, even the scope of a containing block."}

{"prompt": "What role do comments play in the execution of code in Blended?", "completion": "Comments do not affect the execution of the code in Blended. They are purely for documentation and readability."}
{"prompt": "What is the syntax for a comment in the Blended programming language?", "completion": "Comments in Blended are denoted by {# \u2026 #}."}
{"prompt": "What will the outcome be if the input to the `items` filter is not a dictionary?", "completion": "If the input to the `items` filter is not a dictionary, it will result in an error or an unexpected output, as the filter is not designed to handle non-dictionary inputs."}

{"prompt": "Can I apply a variable set at the bottom of a for loop in the else statement?", "completion": "Yes, you can use a variable set at the bottom of a for loop in the else block because the else block is executed after the loop, and the loop scope is cleared upon each iteration."}
{"prompt": "Can a code segment be utilized in multiple statements within Blended?", "completion": "Yes, a code segment can be used in multiple statements in Blended. However, the behavior of the code segment may vary depending on the statement to which it belongs."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the `items` filter when used with dictionaries?", "completion": "The `items` filter takes a dictionary object as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary."}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to define a function inside another function in Blended?", "completion": "Yes, functions can be defined within another function in Blended. However, the function defined within another function is only accessible within the scope of the parent function."}
{"prompt": "What occurs when a variable is declared within a macro and subsequently utilized within a block tag?", "completion": "The variable is not accessible in the block tag, as it is defined in the macro scope."}
{"prompt": "What occurs if a macro in Blended shares the name of a variable defined in the same scope?", "completion": "The macro will not be defined, and we will get an error from the compiler"}
{"prompt": "Does the 'else' part of the loop have access to the 'forloop' variable?", "completion": "No, the 'else' segment does not have access to the 'forloop' variable."}
{"prompt": "What will be the outcome if I use the safe filter on a Safe string?", "completion": "Applying the safe filter to a Safe string does not change its status. A Safe string remains Safe."}
{"prompt": "What effect does the rule have on the order of static text and statements in a Blended template?", "completion": "The resultant template instance retains the ordered relationship of the static text to any statements contained within that text."}
{"prompt": "How does Blended-Lint guarantee that a valid Blended template will function consistently across different runtime environments?", "completion": "Blended-Lint constructs rules to ensure that a valid Blended template will execute in exactly the same way regardless of what Blended-compatible runtime is used."}
{"prompt": "What happens when a variable is declared in a parent scope and then redefined in a child scope?", "completion": "In Blended, multiple declarations of a variable are not allowed. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error."}
{"prompt": "Can I use a template that contains block tags or extends tags in Blended?", "completion": "No, you cannot import a template that contains block tags or an extends tag in Blended."}
{"prompt": "What is the relationship between statements and the context in Blended?", "completion": "Statements in Blended interact with the context by accessing and modifying its data, which is essential for controlling the flow and content of the rendered output."}
